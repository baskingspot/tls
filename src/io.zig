//! Blocking socket adapter for the Sans-I/O drive loop.
//!
//! The engine consumes and produces byte slices; the caller owns the
//! transport. Every caller driving a TLS connection over a blocking TCP
//! socket writes the same two loops, so they live here. The engine itself
//! never names std.Io — this module is a leaf that consumers opt into, and
//! Zig's lazy compilation keeps it out of builds that don't.
//!
//! Reads go straight to the socket, not through Io.Reader: readSliceShort
//! loops until the destination is full, and peek/take hand out slices of the
//! Reader's internal buffer, which forces a copy into the caller-owned
//! RecordBuffer. One read lands bytes directly in `rb.writable()` — zero
//! copies, one syscall. Writes loop on short writev counts directly for the
//! same reason: Io.Writer exists to batch small writes, and a TLS record
//! should reach the socket immediately.
