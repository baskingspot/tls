# tls #91 regression probes: run AnvilChainProviderProbe and
# ValidityRoundTripProbe against the jars that are EFFECTIVE on the classpath
# TLS-Anvil itself uses (zig-out/tools/TLS-Anvil.jar + zig-out/tools/lib/*).
# Optional argument: a pristine upstream jar (tls-test-framework-*.jar or
# x509-attacker-*.jar) used to demonstrate the red state. The probe reports
# its effective code sources, so classpath masking is visible, and exits
# nonzero on any failed check.
#
# - A tls-test-framework override is prepended: its class exists in both
#   jars, so shadowing the installed one is enough. The installed provider is
#   upstream-native since v1.5.3 (#146); a v1.5.0-era jar passed here
#   demonstrates the red state the probe guards against.
# - An x509-attacker override REPLACES the installed jar on the probe
#   classpath: merely prepending it would still load the patched-only classes
#   (DateTimeAdapter, package-info) from the installed jar later on the
#   classpath, hiding the red state. TLS-Anvil.jar is deliberately absent
#   from this classpath: its manifest Class-Path lists lib/*.jar relative to
#   its own location, which would pull the INSTALLED x509-attacker jar back
#   in and mask the override. Every class the probe needs lives in lib/.
