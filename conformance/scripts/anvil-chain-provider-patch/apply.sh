# tls conformance patches (#91, #146): rebuild/replace classes inside the
# jars the conformance build installs under zig-out/tools/lib. One remaining
# patch, applied atomically to its own pinned jar with its own provenance
# stamp:
#
# 1. x509-attacker-4.3.10.jar: inject DateTimeAdapter + package-info into
#    de.rub.nds.x509attacker.config. Upstream has no package-info, so JAXB
#    marshals the config's joda-time DateTime validity fields as EMPTY
#    elements; TLS-Attacker's Config.createCopy()/ConfigIO round trips then
#    replace the configured validity dates with the copy's current time. The
#    package-level adapter preserves the configured instants (including
#    deliberately expired/future windows) exactly; it never relaxes any
#    tls-side validation.
#
# The tls-test-framework jar is NO LONGER patched. TLS-Anvil v1.5.3 adopted
# the #91 chain fix upstream: X509CertificateChainProvider now adds a
# critical basicConstraints cA=true to every chain signing certificate
# (RFC 5280 §4.2.1.9), which is exactly what the retired local fork used to
# do. The v1.5.0-era fork and its patch block were removed with the v1.5.3
# bump (#146); probe.sh still verifies the installed (upstream) provider
# carries the fix.
#
# See NOTICE.md for the Apache-2.0 attribution and modification notice.
#
# Called from build.zig with the installed tools lib directory.
