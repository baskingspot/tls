# Security Policy

tls is a TLS 1.3 library. Security is the whole job. Read this before you rely
on it for anything.

## Status: pre-alpha, internally adversarially reviewed

tls has not had an external security audit. The API is not stable. It has not
been deployed anywhere that matters. Do not put it in front of real traffic or
real secrets yet.

That is not false modesty.
[`PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`](https://github.com/baskingspot/tls/blob/main/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md)
tracks exactly what is proven and what isn't, with the evidence behind each
claim. If you're weighing
tls for anything security-sensitive, read that first, then decide.

What tls does have: RFC-cited tests, RFC 8448 known-answer vectors, OpenSSL
interop in both directions, tlsfuzzer and TLS-Anvil conformance runs, Wycheproof
boundary vectors at the crypto seam, fuzzing on the parser and record-decrypt
surfaces, and a documented threat model at
[`docs/research/THREAT_MODEL.md`](https://github.com/baskingspot/tls/blob/main/docs/research/THREAT_MODEL.md).

An internal adversarial security review (Project Glasswing harness: recon →
hunt → validate) ran against the supported parser and state-machine surface in
July 2026. It found three vulnerabilities — an integer-overflow DoS class
across 14 parser bounds-check sites (#72), a server authentication bypass via
the PSK fast-path (#73), and a selectPsk binders-length overflow — all fixed
with regression tests. The recon, findings, and verified-handled results are
at
[`docs/research/security/FINDINGS.md`](https://github.com/baskingspot/tls/blob/main/docs/research/security/FINDINGS.md).
That is real evidence. It is not a substitute for an external audit.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report privately. Do not open a public issue for a security bug.

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting: go to the **Security** tab of this
repository and click **Report a vulnerability**. That opens a private advisory
visible only to the maintainer.

Please include what you'd want if the roles were reversed: affected version or
commit, a description of the flaw, and a reproduction — a failing test, a fuzz
input, a packet capture, or a proof-of-concept. If you have a suggested fix,
even better.

## What's in scope

The TLS 1.3 protocol implementation tls owns: record framing, the handshake
state machine, transcript hashing, key schedule, alert handling, certificate
path validation and hostname verification, and the parser surfaces that consume
attacker-controlled bytes.

Out of scope:

- The libcrypto backend itself (OpenSSL, AWS-LC). Report primitive crypto bugs
  upstream. Report *misuse* of the backend by tls here.
- Anything the caller owns: transport I/O, buffer lifetime, trust-store
  provisioning, the drive loop.
  [`docs/research/THREAT_MODEL.md`](https://github.com/baskingspot/tls/blob/main/docs/research/THREAT_MODEL.md)
  draws the line between tls's responsibilities and the caller's.
- Features that don't exist yet. PSK resumption, 0-RTT, and client cert auth
  are implemented and were covered by the adversarial review; features outside
  the current supported surface (PQ key exchange, TLS 1.2) are tracked as open
  issues, not vulnerabilities.

## Expectations

This is pre-alpha software maintained in the open. There is no response-time SLA.
Reports are read and taken seriously, but fixes land on a best-effort basis until
the project reaches a stage where it can promise more. When tls is ready to make
security commitments it can keep, this file will say so.
