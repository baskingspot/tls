# X.509 cross-signed root fixtures

Small P-256 certificate chain exercising trusted-first path building:

```text
root CA (self-signed, in bundle) -> intermediate CA -> leaf cross.test
```

The twist: the server presents a third certificate, a **cross-signed root** —
the root's subject and public key, but signed by an *untrusted* anchor that is
not in the bundle. This mirrors production chains like example.com's, where
`SSL.com TLS ECC Root CA 2022` is presented cross-signed by Comodo
`AAA Certificate Services` (not in most bundles) while the self-signed
`SSL.com TLS ECC Root CA 2022` is. A verifier that only anchors the *last*
presented certificate fails with issuer-not-found; trusted-first path building
anchors the intermediate against the self-signed root instead.

```text
presented: leaf cross.test -> intermediate -> cross-signed root (issuer: untrusted anchor)
bundle:    root CA (self-signed)
expected:  OK — anchor the intermediate against the root CA
```

The leaf has SAN `DNS:cross.test`. Only the self-signed root is on disk as
PEM (`root.crt`, loaded into the test bundle via `addCertsFromFilePath`); the
leaf/intermediate/cross-signed DERs live in `../fixtures.txtar` as
`crosssigned_*` sections.

Regenerate with OpenSSL:

```sh
# root: the trust anchor that WILL be in the bundle (self-signed)

# other: an untrusted anchor (NOT in the bundle) that cross-signs root's key
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out other.key

```

Private keys and CSRs are intentionally not committed; the tests only need certs.
