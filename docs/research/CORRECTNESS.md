# Correctness and conformance evidence

ztls correctness is built as layered evidence, not a single claim. The core remains
Sans-I/O and allocation-free; external harnesses wrap it only for conformance.

## Local correctness gate

Run the local correctness gate with:

```sh
just ci
```

The authoritative readiness status lives in `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.

`NEGATIVE_SPACE.md` is the supported-surface catalogue of malformed and
malicious peer inputs: each row names ztls's response and the test evidence or
an explicit gap. `THREAT_MODEL.md` defines the attacker capabilities,
defended attack classes, non-goals, and caller responsibilities.

## tlsfuzzer

`conformance/` contains a pytest/tlsfuzzer suite. The fixture starts
`conformance/zig-out/bin/tlsfuzzer_server`, a thin TCP wrapper around the Sans-I/O
`ServerHandshake`, on an ephemeral localhost port and fails if the server process
crashes before or during any test.

Run directly with:

```sh
just conformance/tlsfuzzer -q
```

The suite is protocol conformance evidence: it checks real wire behavior, alerts, and
state transitions against an independently maintained TLS test framework.

**Caveat:** tlsfuzzer tests the ztls server only. Client-side alert/state
behavior against a malicious server is not covered by this runner.

## Wycheproof boundary vectors

`zig build test` runs selected Wycheproof v1 vectors at ztls's libcrypto
boundary. These tests do **not** claim that ztls implements primitive
crypto. ztls does not implement AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, X25519, or ECDSA
primitives. The purpose is to verify wrapper behavior:

- AEAD AAD/nonce/tag plumbing
- invalid tag rejection through `EVP_DecryptFinal_ex`
- X25519 byte order and shared-secret handling
- low-order/identity public key rejection mapped to `error.IdentityElement`

## Fuzzing

Fuzz targets are ordinary Zig tests using `std.testing.fuzz`. Run with Zig's fuzz
mode, for example:

```sh
zig build test -- --fuzz
```

Remaining fuzz gaps are tracked in GitHub issues; add a target here when it
covers a new surface.

The server `handleRecord` fuzz targets cover both the pre-auth boundary where
raw wire bytes first enter the Sans-I/O server and the connected post-auth
record-dispatch boundary. Post-auth fuzz seeds include cryptographically valid
application-data and KeyUpdate records so mutation can reach encrypted dispatch
paths instead of only AEAD authentication failures. `alert.parse` and
`RecordLayer.decrypt` are also fuzzed as local parser/record-boundary surfaces.

## Verification gates

Certificate path validation enforces RFC 5280 name constraints for DNS, IP,
rfc822Name, and URI GeneralName forms, with local chain fixtures covering
permitted and excluded DNS subtrees. The full bettertls harness remains external
suite work rather than local unit evidence.

The client and server handshakes carry explicit verification gates:

- client: Certificate, CertificateVerify, and server Finished must be verified
  before `clientFinished()` can promote to connected/application keys.
- server: client Finished must be verified before the server transitions to
  connected/application keys.

This mirrors rustls's proof-token idea in a Zig-appropriate form: the final
connected transition has an auditable local condition rather than relying on a
large implicit control-flow argument.


## External suite policy

Active readiness status lives in `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`; suite scope and
skip lists live in `conformance/`. This file keeps only runner mechanics and
the rationale for each suite.
