A TLS 1.3 implementation that does no I/O. You feed it the bytes you read off
the wire; it hands you back the bytes to write. Your socket, your event loop,
your buffers. The engine does the protocol.

It is in production use. The API can still change, so pin a commit.

- [Why this exists](#why-this-exists): when to reach for it, and when to use something mature instead.
- [Guide](#guide): buffer ownership, the drive loop, and working client and server code.
- [API reference](api/): every public declaration.
- [Stability](#stability): the API is not frozen, and how to pin it.

# Why this exists

A TLS library that owns its sockets owns your I/O model too. OpenSSL wants its
BIOs. A language-native library wants a blocking stream, or its own async
runtime, or a callback shape it defines. Pull one in and its assumptions about
how bytes move become your assumptions.

That works until you are writing an io_uring server, or running a custom event
loop, or accounting for every allocation. Then a library that owns its sockets
fights you, and you spend the time wrapping and shimming a design that assumed
it was in charge.

Sans-I/O separates the protocol from the transport. You give the engine the
bytes that came off the wire. It tells you what to send back and hands you the
decrypted application data. It never touches a socket, never blocks, and has no
thread of its own.

rustls showed this model works in production. The difference here is memory: the
engine never calls an allocator.

## When to use it

- You own your I/O and want to keep owning it: epoll, io_uring, a green-thread
  scheduler, an in-memory test harness. The engine has no opinion about how you
  run.
- You care where memory comes from. The engine holds no heap state. You give it
  buffers and it uses those, so memory behavior is something to reason about
  rather than profile after the fact.
- You are on Zig and do not want a C library's I/O assumptions in your build,
  even though the primitive crypto underneath is still libcrypto.
- You want TLS 1.3 and nothing else. No 1.2 downgrade path, no DTLS, no Windows
  portability layer.

## What it is not for

- **A drop-in OpenSSL replacement.** The engine is the TLS state machine. It does not open sockets, load OS trust stores, or give you a `connect()`. You write the drive loop.
- **The full TLS feature set.** It supports a bounded TLS 1.3 surface. [`PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`](https://github.com/baskingspot/tls/blob/main/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md) is the authority on what is proven and what is not.
- **A stable API.** Signatures move. Pin a commit if you build on it.

If you need a mature, audited TLS stack right now, use rustls or OpenSSL. That is the right answer for most people, and this guide will say so when it changes.

## The performance argument

Performance is why the library exists, not why you should adopt it yet. The claim is narrow: on in-memory application-data benchmarks it does less work per record than libssl across the board, and less than rustls on AES-GCM. It loses to rustls on small ChaCha20-Poly1305 records, and that row ships with the disassembly that explains why.

The caveats are in the [README](https://github.com/baskingspot/tls/blob/main/README.md) and in [`docs/research/PERFORMANCE.md`](https://github.com/baskingspot/tls/blob/main/docs/research/PERFORMANCE.md): three n=10 captures (x86_64, aarch64, macOS), a measurement-shape difference between harnesses, and a 15% regression gate that runs by hand on EC2 rather than in CI. The numbers are measurements, not a marketing headline. When the methodology is hardened enough to make a headline claim, the claim will point at reproducible numbers.

Until then the argument is architectural: Sans-I/O and no engine allocations are what make the performance ceiling high.

# Guide

The engine is a pure TLS 1.3 state machine. You supply the bytes, the buffers, the transport I/O, and the drive loop. Protocol code allocates no memory; production crypto backends can allocate inside provider operations.

## Mental model

```
     Network bytes (TLS records)
           |         ^
     feed  |         | drain
           v         |
     +-----+---------+-----+
     |                     |
     |    Engine (tls)    |
     |    state machine    |
     |                     |
     +-----+---------+-----+
           |         ^
    read   |         | write
           v         |
     Plaintext application data
```

The engine owns the TLS protocol: framing, encryption, transcript hashing, alerts, and key ratcheting. The caller owns all buffers, all transport I/O, and the drive loop that moves bytes between the two.

## Walkthrough: start with these examples

To start from running code, these examples are built and run in CI:

- [`examples/in_memory_handshake.zig`](https://github.com/baskingspot/tls/blob/main/examples/in_memory_handshake.zig): both engines in one process, no sockets. Read this first: it shows the full 1-RTT handshake and application data in both directions.
- [`examples/tcp_loopback.zig`](https://github.com/baskingspot/tls/blob/main/examples/tcp_loopback.zig): client and server over `std.net.Stream` on loopback.
- [`examples/epoll_pingpong.zig`](https://github.com/baskingspot/tls/blob/main/examples/epoll_pingpong.zig): non-blocking Linux epoll client/server ping-pong.
- [`examples/iouring_pingpong.zig`](https://github.com/baskingspot/tls/blob/main/examples/iouring_pingpong.zig): Linux io_uring client/server ping-pong.
- [`integrations/tls-ktls/examples/ktls_pingpong.zig`](https://github.com/baskingspot/tls/blob/main/integrations/tls-ktls/examples/ktls_pingpong.zig): Zig 0.16/Linux userspace handshake followed by kernel TX/RX, live KeyUpdate, and explicit close alerts.

`just examples-ci` builds and runs the core paths. The Zig 0.16 integration gate runs the packaged examples and tests. When this page and the examples disagree, the examples are right.

## Fresh project setup

Use Zig 0.16. The library links a libcrypto-family provider through `pkg-config`; the repository devshell supplies OpenSSL by default.

Start from Zig's generated project files so `build.zig.zon` gets a valid package fingerprint:

```sh
mkdir hello-tls
cd hello-tls
zig init
```

Fetch tls from `main`; Zig records a content hash even though the branch moves:

```sh
zig fetch --save https://github.com/baskingspot/tls/archive/main.tar.gz
```

Keep the fingerprint generated by `zig init`. For a sibling checkout instead,
use a path relative to the consumer project root:

```zig
.dependencies = .{
    .tls = .{ .path = "../tls" },
},
```

Wire the core dependency module into the executable in `build.zig`:

```zig
const tls_dep = b.dependency("tls", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});

const exe_mod = b.createModule(.{
    .root_source_file = b.path("src/main.zig"),
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
    .imports = &.{.{ .name = "tls", .module = tls_dep.module("tls") }},
});
const exe = b.addExecutable(.{ .name = "hello-tls", .root_module = exe_mod });
```

Then import tls from application code:

```zig
const tls = @import("tls");
```

The root package also exposes all three integration modules from the same fetch:

| Dependency module | Import name | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| `tls` | caller-chosen, normally `tls` | Zig 0.16 |
| `tls_std` | caller-chosen, normally `tls_std` | Zig 0.16 |
| `tls_xev` | caller-chosen, normally `tls_xev` | Zig 0.16 and the dependency option `.xev = true` |
| `tls_ktls` | caller-chosen, normally `tls_ktls` | Zig 0.16 on Linux |

For example, a `tls-std` consumer replaces the import entry above with:

```zig
.imports = &.{.{
    .name = "tls_std",
    .module = tls_dep.module("tls_std"),
}},
```

A libxev consumer opts in when resolving the dependency so core-only consumers
do not fetch libxev:

```zig
const tls_dep = b.dependency("tls", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
    .xev = true,
});
const tls_xev = tls_dep.module("tls_xev");
```

All imported modules use the same libcrypto headers and library. Select them
through `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`. The compiler infers OpenSSL, AWS-LC, or BoringSSL
from the selected headers. Add `.@"crypto-fips" = true` only to narrow OpenSSL
or AWS-LC capabilities for an explicitly configured FIPS build.

Importing `tls_xev` without `.xev = true` reports the missing opt-in. The three
integration directories keep standalone manifests for in-tree development, but
external consumers should depend only on the root package. For a commit URL,
use `zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/baskingspot/tls#<commit>` and keep
the generated hash; do not hand-write dependency hashes.

## Supported surface for adopters

The engine speaks TLS 1.3 only. The supported user-facing path is server-authenticated 1-RTT over caller-owned buffers.

| Area | Supported path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| TLS versions | TLS 1.3 | TLS 1.2 and DTLS are out of scope. |
| Cipher suites | `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`, `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256` | Suite expansion is provider work. |
| Key exchange | X25519, P-256, opt-in P-384, and the three opt-in RFC 10024 hybrid groups on both roles | P-384 and the hybrids have bidirectional OpenSSL 3.6 interop on every non-FIPS backend. The hybrids also pass the pinned upstream tlsfuzzer matrix. FIPS backend identities reject hybrid configuration. |
| Authentication | Server certificate authentication and client certificate authentication (formerly #4) | |
| Resumption | PSK/session resumption (formerly #2) and 0-RTT with caller-owned anti-replay (formerly #3) | |
| HRR | In-memory and TLS-Anvil; OpenSSL forced-HRR interop is ungated (formerly #1) | |

## Buffer ownership

- **Caller owns every buffer.** The engine holds no heap state and never allocates.
- **`out`**: caller-provided scratch for records the engine emits (ClientHello, Finished, app data, alerts).
- **`storage`**: caller-provided backing for `RecordBuffer`, which turns a byte stream into whole records.
- **Records are decrypted in place.** `RecordBuffer.next()` returns a mutable slice into `storage`. Hand it to `handleRecord`, which may mutate it during decryption. The slice is valid only until the next `next()` or `writable()` call.
- **Application data** returned in `Event.application_data` is a slice into that same record buffer. Copy it before the next engine call if you need it longer.

## RecordBuffer: stream to record framing

Transports deliver bytes; the engine consumes complete TLS records. `RecordBuffer` bridges the gap.

```zig
var storage: [tls.RecordBuffer.recommended_storage]u8 = undefined;
var rb: tls.RecordBuffer = .init(&storage);

// Read transport bytes into the free region.
const n = try stream.read(rb.writable());
if (n == 0) return error.PeerClosed;
rb.advance(n);

// Pull whole records and feed them to the engine.
while (try rb.next()) |record| {
    const ev = try hs.handleRecord(record, &out);
    // ... handle event
}
```

- `writable()` compacts unconsumed bytes to the front, then returns the largest contiguous free region.
- `advance(n)` reports how many bytes were written.
- `next()` returns `null` until a full record is buffered. No partial record is ever handed out.
- `recommended_storage = 2 * min_storage` (about 33 KiB). This fits a partial record plus a full one, so a read that straddles a boundary still makes progress.

## The drive loop

Every connection follows the same pattern, whether client or server:

1. **Emit** — call an engine method that produces bytes (`start`, `handleRecord`, `sendApplicationData`).
2. **Write** — send those bytes to the transport.
3. **Acknowledge** — call `completeWrite()` to tell the engine the bytes were sent.
4. **Read** — pull more bytes from the transport into `RecordBuffer`.
5. **Repeat** until connected, then keep repeating for application data.

### Client drive loop

```zig
var out: tls.ClientHandshake.OutBuffer = .empty;
var storage: tls.RecordBuffer.Storage = .empty;
var rb: tls.RecordBuffer = .init(&storage.buffer);

var random: tls.Random = undefined;
std.crypto.random.bytes(&random.data);

var hs: tls.ClientHandshake = .init(.{
    .keypairs = try .init(keypair),
    .host_name = "example.com",
    .now_sec = std.time.timestamp(),
    .random = random,
});

try stream.writeAll(try hs.start(&out.buffer));
hs.completeWrite();

while (!hs.isConnected()) {
    const n = try stream.read(rb.writable());
    if (n == 0) return error.ServerClosed;
    rb.advance(n);
    while (try rb.next()) |record| switch (try hs.handleRecord(record, &out.buffer)) {
        .write => |w| {
            try stream.writeAll(w);
            hs.completeWrite();
        },
        .application_data, .closed => return error.UnexpectedDuringHandshake,
        .none => {},
    };
}
```

### Server drive loop

The server loop is identical in shape, with two differences:

1. `ServerHandshake.Config` carries the ServerHello random up front.
2. Server credentials are configured before the ClientHello arrives, and `sendServerFlightBuffered` sends the authenticated server flight after ServerHello is written.

```zig
var random: tls.Random = undefined;
std.crypto.random.bytes(&random.data);
var hs: tls.ServerHandshake = .init(.{
    .keypairs = try .init(server_keypair),
    .random = random,
    .alpn_protocols = &.{"h2"},
});

var signer: tls.signature.PrivateKey = try .fromP256Scalar(scalar[0..32]);
defer signer.deinit();
hs.setCredentials(&.{cert_der}, signer.signer());

var out: tls.ServerHandshake.OutBuffer = .empty;
var flight: tls.ServerHandshake.FlightBuffer = .empty;
var storage: tls.RecordBuffer.Storage = .empty;
var rb: tls.RecordBuffer = .init(&storage.buffer);

while (!hs.isConnected()) {
    const n = try stream.read(rb.writable());
    if (n == 0) return error.ClientClosed;
    rb.advance(n);
    while (try rb.next()) |record| {
        switch (try hs.handleRecord(record, &out.buffer)) {
            .write => |w| {
                try stream.writeAll(w);
                hs.completeWrite();
                if (try hs.sendServerFlightBuffered(&flight)) |flight_bytes| {
                    try stream.writeAll(flight_bytes);
                    hs.completeWrite();
                }
            },
            .none => {},
            .application_data, .closed => return error.UnexpectedDuringHandshake,
        }
        if (hs.isConnected()) break;
    }
}
```

Break out as soon as client Finished makes the server connected. Any later
record already in `rb` remains buffered; this gives post-handshake work such as
a `NewSessionTicket` write priority over coalesced application data.

## The `pending_write` interlock

Every engine method that produces bytes sets an internal `pending_write` flag. The next engine call returns `error.PendingWrite` until `completeWrite()` clears the flag.

This prevents a silent desync: if the caller drops a write (kernel buffer full, async task cancelled, early return), the engine would otherwise advance its sequence numbers while the peer never saw the record. `pending_write` forces the caller to acknowledge every emitted record before the state machine moves on.

Rules:
- Call `completeWrite()` **immediately after** the bytes are written to the transport.
- Never call two engine send-methods in a row without `completeWrite()` between them.
- In async code, `completeWrite()` belongs in the write-completion callback.

For blocking transports, keep it simple:

```zig
try stream.writeAll(record);
hs.completeWrite();
```

For non-blocking transports, use `tls.Outbox` to own the unsent tail and call
`completeWrite()` only after the full TLS record drains:

```zig
const Sender = struct {
    fd: std.posix.fd_t,

    pub fn write(self: Sender, bytes: []const u8) !usize {
        return std.posix.send(self.fd, bytes, 0) catch |err| switch (err) {
            error.WouldBlock => 0,
            else => return err,
        };
    }
};

var outbox: tls.Outbox = .init;
const sender: Sender = .{ .fd = fd };
const result = try outbox.send(&hs, record, sender);

// Later, when the fd is writable again:
const next_result = try outbox.flush(&hs, sender);
```

`FlushResult.drained` means the record fully drained and `completeWrite()` was
called; `FlushResult.pending` means bytes remain queued and the caller should
retry `flush` when the transport is writable again.

```zig
_ = result;
_ = next_result;
```

`Outbox` borrows the queued record slice, so the output buffer that produced the
record must stay alive and unchanged until `outbox.writeBlocked()` is false. The
writer contract is intentionally tiny: `write(bytes)` returns the number of
bytes accepted, and `0` means no progress / would-block. While an outbox owns a
record, do not call `completeWrite()` manually; the outbox does that after a full
record drain. The writer must not call back into tls.

## Event union

`handleRecord` returns an `Event`:

| Variant             | Meaning                                      | When it occurs                              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `.write: []const u8` | A record that must be sent to the peer       | Client Finished, KeyUpdate response         |
| `.application_data`  | Decrypted plaintext from the peer            | Connected phase only                        |
| `.none`              | Nothing to send; state advanced internally   | ChangeCipherSpec discarded, flight partial  |
| `.closed`            | Peer sent `close_notify`                     | Any phase                                   |

`.application_data` during the handshake is an error (`UnexpectedDuringHandshake`) because application data must not arrive before the handshake completes.

## kTLS key export

After the handshake is connected, `txKtlsInfo()` and `rxKtlsInfo()` return copied Linux kTLS key material for the current traffic-key epoch. `tx` is the local write direction; `rx` is the peer write direction. The core still does no socket I/O and does not call `setsockopt`.

The Zig 0.16/Linux [`integrations/tls-ktls`](https://github.com/baskingspot/tls/blob/main/integrations/tls-ktls/README.md) package owns the safe activation and data-plane lifecycle. It requires an empty `RecordBuffer`, no pending engine write, no unanswered KeyUpdate request, and an application-level barrier preventing the peer from racing a new record into the socket during activation; keeps key snapshots internal to immediate `setsockopt` calls; receives control-record metadata with `recvmsg`; processes kernel-decrypted records through `receiveKtlsRecord`; ratchets external TX records through `ratchetKtlsTx`; and sends `close_notify` explicitly. Use that package instead of open-coding the sequence from the raw getters.

The raw exports remain available for specialized integrations. They are immediate-use snapshots: retaining one across any record operation, or reinstalling stale sequence/key material, can cause epoch desynchronization or nonce reuse.

## Server credentials

Unlike the client, which only needs a certificate policy, the server must send a certificate chain and sign the `CertificateVerify` message. Configure that before processing the ClientHello:

```zig
var signer: tls.signature.PrivateKey = try .fromP256Scalar(scalar[0..32]);
defer signer.deinit();
// RFC 6979 deterministic nonces (mattrobenolt/tls#82): reproducible
// CertificateVerify bytes for seeded test harnesses; see "Signing and key
// exchange" for the capability contract.
// signer.nonce_mode = .deterministic;
server.setCredentials(&.{leaf_cert_der}, signer.signer());
```

The certificate chain is a DER slice list in leaf-first order. `sendServerFlightBuffered` uses the configured credentials, owns the authenticated-flight one-shot latch, and returns `null` if there is no server flight to send.

```zig
var flight: tls.ServerHandshake.FlightBuffer = .empty;
if (try server.sendServerFlightBuffered(&flight)) |flight_bytes| {
    try stream.writeAll(flight_bytes);
    server.completeWrite();
}
```

`sendAuthenticatedFlight` remains available as a lower-level escape hatch, but new callers should prefer up-front `setCredentials` plus `sendServerFlightBuffered`. On PSK resumption these methods automatically omit Certificate and CertificateVerify. `PrivateKey.deinit()` zeroes key material via libcrypto.

## Server session tickets

After verifying client Finished, a server can issue one or more resumable TLS
1.3 tickets without allocating. Ticket identity encoding, persistence,
expiration, key rotation, replay policy, absolute resumption-chain lifetime,
and any client-auth identity continuity remain caller policy.

```zig
var prepared = try server.deriveTicketPsk();
defer prepared.secureZero();

// Stage prepared.psk and prepared.cipher_suite under this opaque identity, or
// include them in a caller-encrypted and authenticated stateless ticket.
const identity = "opaque-ticket";

// `fresh_ticket_age_add` came from the application's CSPRNG for this ticket.
const record = try server.sendNewSessionTicket(
    &prepared,
    .{
        .ticket_lifetime = 3600,
        .ticket_age_add = fresh_ticket_age_add,
        .ticket = identity,
    },
    &out.buffer,
);
try stream.writeAll(record);
server.completeWrite();
```

`deriveTicketPsk()` assigns a unique per-connection nonce and permits only one
prepared ticket at a time. RFC 8446 §4.6.1 puts `ticket_age_add` freshness on
the server; tls owns no CSPRNG, so the caller must provide a fresh
cryptographically random value for every call. Ticket identities are non-empty
and at most 256 bytes so tls clients can cache them. The server emits one ticket per
record, caps issuance at 32 tickets per connection, and does not advertise
0-RTT from this API.

Clients that did not advertise `psk_dhe_ke` make ticket preparation fail with
`error.IncompatiblePskModes`. Commit a stateful ticket row only after the record
has been fully written. If identity construction or persistence fails, call
`discardTicketPsk()`; it erases the PSK and burns the nonce.

Issue and flush every userspace ticket before kTLS activation. A prepared ticket
blocks `tls_ktls.Server.activate`; after successful activation,
`deriveTicketPsk()` and `sendNewSessionTicket()` fail with
`error.KtlsTxActive`.

PSK resumption never implicitly preserves a client-certificate identity. A
server configured for fresh client authentication declines offered PSKs and
runs a full authenticated handshake. Applications that intentionally carry an
identity in a ticket must authenticate and authorize that caller-owned ticket
state themselves.

## SNI (server name indication)

After `handleRecord` returns the first `.write` event (the ServerHello), the server can read the hostname the client requested:

```zig
if (server.clientServerName()) |name| {
    // select certificate based on `name`
}
```

`clientServerName()` returns `null` if the client sent no `server_name` extension. The slice points into the caller's record buffer; copy it if you need it past the next `handleRecord` call.

> Virtual hosting pattern: call `handleRecord` for the ClientHello, inspect `clientServerName()`, select the appropriate keypair/cert, call `setCredentials`, then send the authenticated flight with `sendServerFlightBuffered`.

## ALPN

Both sides offer protocol lists before the handshake begins:

```zig
// Client — via Config at init time
var hs: tls.ClientHandshake = .init(.{
    .keypairs = try .init(keypair),
    .host_name = "example.com",
    .now_sec = std.time.timestamp(),
    .random = random,
    .alpn_protocols = &.{ "h2", "http/1.1" },
});
// or after init:
// client.offerAlpn(&.{ "h2", "http/1.1" });

// Server
server.supportAlpn(&.{"h2"});
```

After the handshake, `selectedAlpnProtocol()` returns the negotiated protocol (or `null` if none was agreed). The server picks the first entry from its list that the client also offered; if both sides sent ALPN but no protocol matches, `acceptClientHello` returns `error.NoApplicationProtocol`. The client rejects a server-selected protocol that was not offered (`error.UnofferedAlpnProtocol`).

## RFC 10024 hybrid key exchange

Hybrid groups are opt-in. The non-FIPS OpenSSL, AWS-LC, and BoringSSL backends support all three RFC 10024 groups. The provider supplies pure ML-KEM operations. The engine owns group negotiation and classical-secret composition. FIPS backend identities advertise no hybrid groups.

`tls.capabilities.active_backend` identifies the inferred backend and explicit FIPS policy. `tls.capabilities.is_fips` reports compile-time FIPS narrowing. It does not prove the provider runtime mode. `supportsHybridGroup(role, group)` reports role support. Provider operations can still fail at runtime.

Start with one group:

```zig
const hybrid_groups = [_]tls.kex.NamedGroup{.x25519_mlkem768};
try tls.capabilities.validateHybridGroups(.client, &hybrid_groups);
try tls.capabilities.validateHybridGroups(.server, &hybrid_groups);

var client_keypairs: tls.ClientHandshake.KeyPairs = try .init(.generate());
defer client_keypairs.secureZero();
const client_config: tls.ClientHandshake.Config = .{
    .keypairs = client_keypairs,
    .host_name = "example.com",
    .now_sec = std.time.timestamp(),
    .random = client_random,
    .hybrid = .{
        .supported_groups = &hybrid_groups,
        .initial_key_share = .x25519_mlkem768,
    },
};
try client_config.validate();
var client: tls.ClientHandshake = .init(client_config);
defer client.deinit();

var server_keypairs: tls.ServerHandshake.KeyPairs = try .init(.generate());
defer server_keypairs.secureZero();
const server_config: tls.ServerHandshake.Config = .{
    .keypairs = server_keypairs,
    .random = server_random,
    .hybrid_groups = &hybrid_groups,
};
try server_config.validate();
var server: tls.ServerHandshake = .init(server_config);
defer server.deinit();
```

Set `initial_key_share = null` to omit the hybrid share from ClientHello1. A compatible server can select the group through HelloRetryRequest.

A hybrid offer still permits classical key exchange. Invalid explicit policy never causes a silent classical fallback. A failure after hybrid selection ends the handshake.

`error.InvalidHybridPolicy` reports malformed lists or an inconsistent initial share. `error.HybridGroupUnavailable` reports compile-time backend policy. `error.MissingP384KeyPair` reports absent P-384 material.

`secp384r1_mlkem1024` requires a P-384 keypair on each enabled role. All three group values can appear in one policy.

The group slices are borrowed. They must outlive the handshake. A reusable xev configuration requires them until every associated connection ends.

Call `tls-std` option `validate()` methods before socket creation. `connect` and `accept` repeat validation before key generation. The fallible xev configuration constructors validate before trust-store work.

## Certificate policy

The client validates the server certificate chain against a caller-owned policy.
The `Config` struct seeds `policy` at init time from `host_name`, `now_sec`,
`bundle`, and `insecure_no_chain_anchor`; `policy` remains public for advanced
overrides after init:

```zig
var hs: tls.ClientHandshake = .init(.{
    .keypairs = try .init(keypair),
    .host_name = "example.com",      // SAN/CN check + SNI
    .now_sec = std.time.timestamp(),  // validity-period check
    .bundle = &bundle,                // trust-anchor anchoring
    .random = random,
});
// Advanced override (optional):
// hs.policy.insecure_no_chain_anchor = true;  // test/demo only
```

A client policy without `bundle` rejects the server Certificate unless the
caller explicitly sets `insecure_no_chain_anchor = true` for a test/demo
fixture. The bundle type is Zig's `std.crypto.Certificate.Bundle`; load it from
the trust anchors appropriate for your application and keep it caller-owned for
the connection lifetime. The insecure fixture mode still verifies
CertificateVerify key possession, but it does not authenticate the chain to any
trust root.

## Close semantics

A clean close is a bidirectional `close_notify` alert exchange (RFC 8446 §6.1). Send one when you're done:

```zig
const rec = try engine.sendAlert(.close_notify, &out);
try stream.writeAll(rec);
engine.completeWrite();
```

When the peer sends `close_notify`, `handleRecord` returns `.closed`. Receiving `.closed` does not automatically send a `close_notify` back — the caller decides whether to half-close, reply in kind, or simply drop the connection.

Fatal alerts (`decode_error`, `unexpected_message`, etc.) are sent the same way but always at fatal level:

```zig
const rec = try engine.sendAlert(.decode_error, &out);
try stream.writeAll(rec);
// don't call completeWrite; treat the connection as dead
```

Before the handshake is encrypted (`.wait_ch` state), `sendAlert` emits a plaintext alert record. Once handshake keys are installed, all alerts are encrypted.

## Peer alert diagnostics

When the peer sends a non-close_notify alert — a fatal error alert, or a warning-level `user_canceled` — `handleRecord` returns `error.PeerAlert` (RFC 8446 §6.2). The engine retains the exact level and description so you can log it:

```zig
_ = engine.handleRecord(record, &out) catch |err| switch (err) {
    error.PeerAlert => {
        if (engine.lastPeerAlert()) |peer_alert| {
            // Level/Description are non-exhaustive: unknown codes are legal
            // on the wire, so tagName can return null. Fall back to the code.
            const level_name = std.enums.tagName(tls.alert.Level, peer_alert.level)
                orelse "unknown";
            const desc_name = std.enums.tagName(tls.alert.Description, peer_alert.description)
                orelse "unknown";
            // e.g. "peer alert: fatal(2)/handshake_failure(40)"
            std.log.err("peer alert: {s}({d})/{s}({d})", .{
                level_name,
                @intFromEnum(peer_alert.level),
                desc_name,
                @intFromEnum(peer_alert.description),
            });
        }
        return err; // the connection is dead
    },
    else => return err,
};
```

`lastPeerAlert()` returns null until the first peer alert; a later peer alert replaces an earlier one, while `close_notify` (§6.1) and malformed records leave it unchanged, and reinitialization clears it. Do not use `@tagName` directly on these values — unknown codes would panic. The engine still returns `error.PeerAlert`; only the detail is new.

## Buffer sizing

| Purpose | Public type or bound | Capacity contract |
|---|---|---|
| Client output | `ClientHandshake.OutBuffer` | Holds one maximum wire record. |
| Server output | `ServerHandshake.OutBuffer` | Holds one maximum wire record. |
| Server flight | `ServerHandshake.FlightBuffer` | Holds one authenticated server flight. |
| Stream input | `RecordBuffer.Storage` | Uses `RecordBuffer.recommended_storage`. |
| Minimum stream input | `RecordBuffer.MinStorage` | Holds one maximum wire record. |

Use the public buffer types unless the application needs custom storage. Smaller custom slices can return `error.BufferTooShort`.

## API reference

Public symbols used by the guide and examples. The walkthrough above is the canonical explanation of the drive loop.

### `ClientHandshake`

Caller-owned types:

- `ClientHandshake.OutBuffer`: scratch for ClientHello, Finished, application data, alerts, and KeyUpdate records. Use `.empty` for the default stack-backed shape.
- `ClientHandshake.Storage`: optional handshake-message reassembly storage. Use `.empty` and pass `&storage.buffer` to `useHandshakeBuffer` for unusual chain sizes or tighter memory control.

Common drive methods:

- `init(config)` / `deinit()` create and release a client handshake. `Config` requires `keypairs`, `host_name`, `now_sec`, and `random`. Other fields have defaults.
- `offerAlpn(protocols)`: advertise application protocols before `start` (also settable via `Config.alpn_protocols`).
- `useHandshakeBuffer(storage)`: attach caller-owned handshake reassembly storage (also settable via `Config.reassembly`).
- `start(out)`: emit ClientHello using `Config.host_name` (SNI) and `Config.random`.
- `handleRecord(record, out)`: consume one TLS record from `RecordBuffer.next()` and return `Event`.
- `isConnected()`: true after the server Finished verifies and application keys are installed.
- `sendApplicationData(plaintext, out)` / `sendPreparedApplicationData(len, out)`: emit one encrypted application-data record.
- `sendAlert(description, out)`: emit `close_notify` or a fatal alert.
- `sendKeyUpdate(request, out)`: emit a post-handshake KeyUpdate.
- `txKtlsInfo()` / `rxKtlsInfo()`: copy current traffic-key epoch material for caller-owned Linux kTLS setup.
- `completeWrite()`: acknowledge the previous emitted record.
- `selectedAlpnProtocol()`: negotiated ALPN protocol, or `null`.
- `lastPeerAlert()`: the most recent non-close_notify peer alert (RFC 8446 §6.2), or `null`; see Peer alert diagnostics.

Policy fields (seeded from `Config` at init, overridable after):

| Field | Config field | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `policy.host_name` | `Config.host_name` | Expected DNS name for SAN/CN verification + SNI. |
| `policy.bundle` | `Config.bundle` | Caller-owned trust-anchor bundle. |
| `policy.now_sec` | `Config.now_sec` | Validity-period timestamp. |
| `policy.insecure_no_chain_anchor` | `Config.insecure_no_chain_anchor` | Test/demo opt-out from trust-anchor verification. |

Low-level in-memory hooks exist for fixture-style handshakes with no transport between engines: `processServerHello`, `processFlight`, and `clientFinished`. Prefer the normal `start` + `handleRecord` loop for transport integrations.

### `ServerHandshake`

Caller-owned types:

- `ServerHandshake.OutBuffer`: scratch for ServerHello, application data, alerts, and KeyUpdate records.
- `ServerHandshake.FlightBuffer`: scratch for the encrypted authenticated server flight. Reuse one buffer; `sendServerFlightBuffered` owns the one-shot latch.
- `ServerHandshake.Storage`: optional ClientHello reassembly storage. Use `.empty` and pass `&storage.buffer` to `useHandshakeBuffer`.

Common drive methods:

- `init(Config)` / `deinit()`: create and release a server handshake. Required Config fields are `keypairs` and `random`; optional fields include `supported_suites`, `alpn_protocols`, `client_auth`, and ClientHello `reassembly` storage.
- `supportSuites(suites)`: override the Config-provided cipher-suite list before processing ClientHello.
- `supportAlpn(protocols)`: override the Config-provided ALPN choices before processing ClientHello.
- `setCredentials(certs, signer)` / `setCertificateChain(chain, signer)`: attach a leaf-first certificate chain and signer before processing ClientHello.
- `useHandshakeBuffer(storage)`: attach or override caller-owned ClientHello reassembly storage before processing ClientHello.
- `handleRecord(record, out)`: consume one TLS record from `RecordBuffer.next()` and return `Event`.
- `sendServerFlightBuffered(flight)` / `sendPreparedServerFlight(out)`: emit the authenticated server flight after ServerHello is written and acknowledged.
- `needsServerFlight()`: true while the authenticated flight still needs to be sent.
- `isConnected()`: true after the client Finished verifies and application keys are installed.
- `clientServerName()`: SNI hostname, or `null`.
- `selectedAlpnProtocol()`: negotiated ALPN protocol, or `null`.
- `lastPeerAlert()`: the most recent non-close_notify peer alert (RFC 8446 §6.2), or `null`; see Peer alert diagnostics.
- `sendApplicationData(plaintext, out)` / `sendPreparedApplicationData(len, out)`: emit one encrypted application-data record.
- `sendAlert(description, out)` and `sendKeyUpdate(request, out)`: post-handshake emits.
- `txKtlsInfo()` / `rxKtlsInfo()`: copy current traffic-key epoch material for caller-owned Linux kTLS setup.
- `completeWrite()`: acknowledge the previous emitted record.
- `extractEstablished()`: at `isConnected()`, exactly once, hand the connection's post-handshake life to a compact `EstablishedSession` (736 bytes on the OpenSSL lane vs the handshake engine's 19,408; see the lane table below) and consume this engine. See below.

Low-level in-memory hooks used by `examples/in_memory_handshake.zig`: `acceptClientHello`, `processClientFinished`, and `receiveApplicationData`.

### `EstablishedSession`

The compact post-handshake server engine, constructed only by
`ServerHandshake.extractEstablished()` at handshake completion (#115). A
connection pool keeps one `ServerHandshake` per worker and one
`tls.EstablishedSession` per live connection. The size is lane-dependent
because each `RecordLayer` embeds its backend AEAD context (measured under
Zig 0.15.2, aarch64-linux; x86_64 compiles to the same numbers; tls now
requires Zig 0.16, so treat these as historical, not current):

| Lane | `EstablishedSession` | `ServerHandshake` |
|---|---|---|
| OpenSSL (heap `EVP_CIPHER_CTX` pointers) | 736 B | 19,408 B |
| AWS-LC 5.5.0 (inline `EVP_AEAD_CTX`) | 1,872 B | 21,120 B |
| BoringSSL (inline `EVP_AEAD_CTX`) | 1,856 B | 21,088 B |

It preserves the traffic record layers and sequences, the
application traffic secrets, an in-flight KeyUpdate fragment, the
consecutive-KeyUpdate counter, the last peer alert, an owed KeyUpdate response,
and the pending-write latch. It runs the same connected record-path code the
handshake engine runs, so classification, KeyUpdate ratchet/response
discipline, the flood cap, and the latch behave identically.

Lifecycle rules:

- Call `extractEstablished()` exactly once, while `isConnected()`. The
  handshake engine becomes unusable (its `State` reports `.extracted`), and the
  record-layer bytes it left behind — which on AWS-LC and BoringSSL are the
  live traffic keys — are wiped immediately at extraction, without freeing the
  moved contexts. `deinit` remains safe to call immediately afterwards: it
  wipes the engine's remaining duplicated secret bytes and never touches the
  moved record-layer contexts.
- Issue NewSessionTickets (and discard any prepared one) BEFORE extracting.
  The established session carries no ticket machinery.
- Both record directions must be userspace when extracting. TX ownership is
  tracked and asserted; RX ownership is not, so it is a caller contract — a
  kernel-installed RX leaves the session's userspace RX sequence stale, and
  misuse fails loudly (`error.AuthenticationFailed`). kTLS callers keep using
  `ServerHandshake` in both directions.

Methods (all mirror their `ServerHandshake` counterparts):

- `deinit()`: release backend contexts and zero the secrets the session owns.
- `handle(record, out)`: decrypt, classify, and auto-respond to an inbound
  `update_requested` KeyUpdate with the response record in `out`.
- `receive(record)`: RX-only classify; a received `update_requested` defers
  the response to the caller (query with `hasPendingKeyUpdateResponse()`).
- `sendApplicationData(plaintext, out)`: refused with
  `error.PendingKeyUpdateResponse` while a response is owed, and with
  `error.PendingWrite` until the previous record is acknowledged.
- `sendAlert(description, out)` / `sendKeyUpdate(request, out)` /
  `ratchetTx(request)` — post-handshake emits; `ratchetTx` advances the TX
  epoch after an external record layer sent a KeyUpdate under the old key.
- `hasPendingWrite()` / `completeWrite()` / `hasPendingKeyUpdateResponse()` /
  `lastPeerAlert()` — the same interlocks and diagnostics as the handshake
  engine.

### `Outbox`

- `Outbox` is optional glue for non-blocking or partial-write transports.
- `send(hs, record, writer)` queues one engine-produced record and flushes as much as the writer accepts.
- `flush(hs, writer)` resumes a partial write.
- `FlushResult.drained` means the full record drained and `completeWrite()` was called; `FlushResult.pending` means retry later.
- `writeBlocked()` is true while one record is still pending; do not call another record-producing engine method while blocked.
- The writer adapter must expose `write(bytes) !usize`; returning `0` means no progress, not success.
- The queued record is borrowed. Keep the backing `OutBuffer` / `FlightBuffer` stable until drained.

### `RecordBuffer`

- `RecordBuffer.Storage` and `RecordBuffer.MinStorage` are stack-friendly storage wrappers.
- `RecordBuffer.recommended_storage` is the normal stream buffer size; `min_storage` fits one maximum wire record.
- `init(storage)` binds caller-owned storage.
- `writable()` returns the slice to fill from the transport and may compact buffered bytes.
- `advance(n)` reports how many bytes the transport wrote into `writable()`.
- `next()` returns the next complete TLS record, or `null` if the buffer only holds a partial record.

### Signing and key exchange

- `CertificateChain.fromPem(pem, der_storage, chain_storage)` decodes RFC 7468 certificate blocks into caller-owned storage. The output buffers must not overlap `pem` and must outlive the chain.
- `signature.PrivateKey.fromPem(scheme, pem)` and `fromDer(scheme, der)` load private keys from caller-owned bytes. The scheme is caller-pinned metadata and is not validated against the key at load time.
- `signature.PrivateKey.fromPemAuto(pem)` (#112) loads the key and infers the CertificateVerify scheme from the key's type and curve (RSA → `rsa_pss_rsae_sha256`, P-256 → `ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256`, P-384 → `ecdsa_secp384r1_sha384`). The inferred scheme is gated against the active backend's advertised CertificateVerify schemes, so a key whose scheme this backend cannot sign (Ed25519, P-521 today) fails at load with `error.UnsupportedKeyScheme` instead of at the first handshake signature. The RFC 8446 §4.2.3 `rsa_pss_pss_*` schemes are not implemented; a backend that loads an rsassaPss-OID key rejects it as `UnsupportedKeyScheme`, while a backend that cannot load the container returns `LibcryptoFailed`. Success means the linked backend advertises the inferred scheme; callers still handle signing failures from malformed or unsuitable key material. A PEM that never loads fails with `error.LibcryptoFailed`.
- Encrypted private keys are not supported (#114). Both PEM loaders pass an explicit provider callback that declines passwords, so an encrypted key: PKCS#8 `ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY` or the legacy `Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED` container — fails with `error.LibcryptoFailed` instead of prompting on the controlling terminal or reading process stdin. Loading is therefore safe on an unattended startup path, and there is no caller-owned password API to pass a passphrase through; decrypt the key with external tooling first, or load plaintext PEM/DER.
- `signature.PrivateKey.pairsWith(leaf_cert_der)` (#113) validates at load time that the private key matches the leaf certificate's public key (RFC 8446 §4.4.3; the leaf is element [0] of the chain). `error.CertificateKeyMismatch` means the leaf parsed but the keys do not pair; `error.InvalidCertificate` means the input is not exactly one DER-encoded X.509 certificate: distinct errors so rotation tooling can tell a wrong pairing from a corrupt file. Both inputs are borrowed; the private key is only read. A `PrivateKey` must outlive every `Signer` it handed out — swap credentials only when no in-flight handshake holds the old signer.
- `signature.PrivateKey.fromP256Scalar(scalar)` is useful for fixtures and examples that carry a raw P-256 scalar.
- `signature.PrivateKey.signer()` borrows a `signature.Signer` vtable for `setCredentials`.
- `signature.PrivateKey.deinit()` releases libcrypto key material.
- `signature.PrivateKey.nonce_mode` selects the ECDSA nonce strategy (`signature.NonceMode`): the default `.random` is the production path; `.deterministic` opts into RFC 6979 deterministic nonces so identical key and message produce identical signature bytes, which makes a seeded handshake transcript byte-reproducible. It requires a backend compiled with nonce-type provider support and an ECDSA scheme; unsupported requests fail loudly: `error.DeterministicNonceUnsupported` for a missing capability or non-ECDSA scheme, `error.LibcryptoFailed` when the provider rejects the parameter — instead of silently signing with a random nonce. Keep `.random` in production.
- `SignatureScheme` names the TLS signature scheme used with a loaded key, including `rsa_pss_rsae_sha256`, `ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256`, `ecdsa_secp384r1_sha384`, and `ed25519`.
- `x25519.KeyPair.generate()` creates a fresh ephemeral X25519 keypair with OS entropy.
- `x25519.KeyPair.fromSecret(secret_key)` derives a keypair from a caller-supplied 32-byte scalar. Production callers must supply fresh CSPRNG bytes for each handshake. The function supports batched entropy draws.
- `x25519.KeyPair.generateDeterministic(seed)` remains available for tests and fixed-vector paths.
- `x25519.sharedSecret(secret_key, peer_public_key, out)` writes the shared secret to caller-owned storage. The function clears the output on error.
- `p256.KeyPair.fromSecret(secret_key)` derives a keypair from a caller-supplied 32-byte scalar. Production callers must supply fresh CSPRNG bytes for each handshake.
- `error.IdentityElement` from `p256.KeyPair.fromSecret` requires a fresh draw. `error.LibcryptoFailed` is terminal.
- `ClientHandshake.KeyPairs.init(x25519_keypair)` generates the P-256 half and can return `p256.Error`. The caller sheds the handshake after failure (#88).
- `initWithP256` and `initWithP256P384` accept fixed caller-supplied keypairs.

### Secret cleanup

After use, call `secureZero()` on each caller-owned X25519, P-256, P-384, or aggregate handshake keypair.

Before release of resumption material, call `SessionTicket.secureZero()`.

After kernel setup, call `KtlsInfo.secureZero()`.

After kernel setup, call `secureZero()` on the packed kTLS value.

After use, call handshake `deinit()` methods to release provider handles and erase each handshake-owned secret copy. `EstablishedSession.deinit()` does the same for the extracted post-handshake session; the consumed handshake engine's own `deinit()` stays safe after extraction.

Do not erase borrowed buffers, `Signer` values, or borrowed PSK slices through these owners.

## Runtime-specific integration notes

The generic drive loop above is the protocol boundary. These notes call out what changes by transport model; the named files are built by `just examples-ci`.

### Blocking `std.net.Stream`

`examples/tcp_loopback.zig` drives a tls client and tls server over loopback TCP. Blocking I/O keeps the ownership rules boring: read into `RecordBuffer.writable()`, feed each complete record to the engine, `writeAll` each emitted record, then call `completeWrite()`.

### In-memory transport

`examples/in_memory_handshake.zig` connects both engines by passing record slices directly. It uses low-level hooks such as `acceptClientHello`, `processServerHello`, `processClientFinished`, and `receiveApplicationData` because there is no byte-stream transport to frame with `RecordBuffer`.

### epoll

`examples/epoll_pingpong.zig` is Linux-only and non-blocking. It uses `tls.Outbox` for the write side: keep at most one engine-emitted record queued, wait for writability if the socket blocks, and do not call another record-producing engine method until the outbox drains. Reads still fill `RecordBuffer.writable()` and records still flow through `handleRecord` one at a time.

### io_uring

`examples/iouring_pingpong.zig` is Linux-only. The setup path may use ordinary blocking `listen` / `accept` / `connect`; the TLS record data path submits sends and receives through io_uring. The same pending-write rule applies: every record emitted by the engine must complete through the ring before the next engine call that can advance protocol state.

## What is not shown here

The engine covers PSK/session resumption, 0-RTT, client certificate authentication,
and HRR in the supported surface. These features are intentionally out of scope
for the examples above:

- Exporters: not implemented, and not planned until someone asks for one.
- A general io_uring or arbitrary-runtime wrapper. In-tree integration packages
  cover `std.Io`, libxev, and Linux kTLS without moving transport I/O into the
  core engine.
