/*
 * ztls — C ABI for the Sans-I/O TLS 1.3 library.
 *
 * This header defines the client-side C ABI surface (#30). The internal
 * layout of ztls_client is opaque: allocate ztls_client_size() bytes with
 * alignment ztls_client_align(), pass the pointer to
 * ztls_client_init_insecure, and
 * do not access the memory directly. Layout is unstable between ztls
 * versions; pin a version and recompile on upgrade.
 *
 * Conventions:
 *   - All functions return ztls_result (ZTLS_OK or an error).
 *   - Pointer parameters must not be NULL unless explicitly documented.
 *   - event.data and out-parameter pointers are borrowed from ztls-internal
 *     or caller buffers; they are valid only until the next ztls call on the
 *     same handle or until ztls_client_complete_write is called.
 *   - The client handle is non-copyable. Do not memcpy or assign it; the
 *     internal state contains backend handles and secrets that must not be
 *     duplicated (#30 C ABI security review finding 1).
 *   - ztls_client_deinit must be called exactly once per handle.
 *
 * Scope: this is a partial C ABI (#30 PARTIAL). Only client lifecycle shims
 * are exported. Server-side shims, RecordBuffer C ABI, certificate
 * verification, KeyUpdate initiation, PSK/resumption, and dynamic linking
 * are deferred.
