# AGENTS.md

This is tls: a Sans-I/O TLS 1.3 library in Zig. No transport I/O. Caller-owned buffers.
Read `docs/research/DESIGN.md` before writing any code.

---

## What This Is

A pure TLS 1.3 state machine. The engine consumes and produces byte slices.
Core library code does not open sockets. tls-owned protocol/state-machine code
must not allocate. Higher-level wrappers that add I/O belong outside the core
engine; repo examples and test shims may use sockets to exercise the Sans-I/O
API.

Target platforms: Linux and macOS. No Windows support, no portability tax.

**Writing about it.** The package name is `tls`, which is also the protocol. So
lowercase `tls` in prose is never bare: it is either in code font, or the
sentence says "the engine", "the library", or "the core" instead. Plain-text
TLS is the protocol and stays uppercase. Never use `tls` as an adjective, as in
"tls clients"; those are clients, or the engine's client role.

---

## Non-Negotiable Principles

**Correctness and performance are co-equal.** Not "make it work, then make it
fast." Both are first-class from the start. A working slow implementation is
not an acceptable intermediate state — correctness decisions shape performance
decisions and vice versa.

**No tls-owned allocations in the TLS engine.** If you find yourself reaching
for an allocator in protocol/framing code, stop. Caller owns all TLS buffers.
The engine holds no heap state. Production crypto backends may perform
documented backend-owned libc/libcrypto allocations; do not hide those behind a
fake no-allocation claim.

**No unnecessary copies.** Avoid memcpy and memmove unless provably
unavoidable. Design buffer layouts to allow in-place and zero-copy paths. If
you add a copy, document why it can't be avoided.

**Memory-conscious struct layout.** Every byte of struct size is a deliberate
choice. Use packed structs, union types, and bit fields where they reduce size
without sacrificing correctness. Profile struct layouts and cache line
behavior on hot paths. Don't leave padding on the table.

**SIMD where it matters.** Zig exposes SIMD via `@Vector`. Hot paths — record
header scanning, AES-GCM, ChaCha, SHA — are candidates. Measure before
applying. Check the generated asm to confirm the compiler did what you think.

**Every line of code is a cost.** Less code is better code. Each line must
justify its existence. If you can delete something and the behavior is
unchanged, delete it. Prefer reading over writing. A 10-line function that's
obviously correct beats a 30-line one that might be.

**Profile, disassemble, benchmark before claiming something is fast.** Use
`perf` on Linux, `Instruments` on macOS. Inspect asm with `objdump -d` or
`llvm-objdump`. Build with `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast` for benchmarks. Gut
feelings about performance are wrong until measured.

---

## Dev Environment

The Nix flake is the source of truth for development tooling. If a recipe,
script, test, or conformance harness needs a command, add it to `flake.nix`;
don't suggest installing it globally and don't make scripts skip because a
devshell dependency is absent. Generated or downloaded artifacts may be recipe
dependencies, but tools should be assumed present in the devshell.

When already inside the devshell, run commands directly. Don't wrap normal
checks in `nix develop --command` unless there is evidence the current shell is
missing the updated environment.

---

## Project State and Continuity

**Read `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` before starting any task.** It is the single
source of truth for what is done, what "done" means, and what is still unproven.
Status lives there and nowhere else. Every other document describes mechanism;
none of them asserts whether something is finished. If you catch another doc
claiming done/not-done, that line is a bug — delete it and point to the spine.
The evidence behind the page — revisions, run IDs, per-claim tables — is
`docs/slop/EVIDENCE.md`. The page states the claim; the log records what ran.

**Write state back in the same change.** When your work changes the evidence
behind a readiness claim, update `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` in the same commit. A
claim whose evidence moved but whose status didn't is a lie. Closing a gap means
updating the dashboard, not just landing the code.

**Search open GitHub issues before filing one; extend the existing issue, don't
fork a parallel one. Two issues for one feature is the failure that produced the
duplicate-record mess — do not reproduce it.**

**Committed files cite GitHub issues (#NN), never pi todos. Every cited issue
must resolve via `gh issue view`, and be open if cited as active work. pi todos
are ephemeral execution scratch — break an issue into todos to delegate to
subagents; never reference a pi todo from a committed artifact.**

**"Closed" means proven, not "a slice landed."** If you did partial work, the
todo and the readiness doc say partial. Never close a todo or upgrade a status on
the strength of a commit that only moves toward the goal. Honest partial beats
false done.

**Preserve Git identity.** Agents must not invent author or committer identities.
Use the configured maintainer identity for agent-authored changes. Preserve real
contributor attribution. Before each commit, inspect `git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT`
and `git var GIT_COMMITTER_IDENT`. If either identity is missing or unexpected,
stop and report it. Do not change Git identity configuration or override identity
through environment variables. Before publication, inspect the raw author and
committer fields with `git log --format=fuller` for every new commit.

**Respect workspace ownership.** The root is the tls library workspace; domain
subprojects such as `conformance/` own their local build/test/fmt/lint workflows
and should be usable from inside that directory. Root just recipes may delegate
to subprojects, but don't smear subproject details back into the root.

**Human docs and agent notes are separate.** Agent working notes, status
dashboards, claims-to-evidence matrices, recon, and hunt records live in
`docs/slop/`. Everything else under `docs/`, and the root `README.md`,
`SECURITY.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`, is written for a person. No human document
links or names `docs/slop/`; `just lint` enforces this. `AGENTS.md` and
`.pi/` may link in. Date-stamped capture directories are records, not prose,
and the rule does not classify them. When a note is only useful to an agent,
put it in `docs/slop/` and do not wire it into the research index.

---

## Agent Operating Loop

For non-trivial work, keep the loop tight:

1. Pick one issue slice.
2. Verify the current claim against code/docs before editing.
3. Implement the smallest honest change.
4. Run the relevant checks.
5. Update `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` if evidence/status changed.
6. Commit and push the slice.
7. Comment on the GitHub issue with evidence and residual scope.

Do not broaden a slice because nearby work looks tempting. If a slice is partial,
say partial in the issue and readiness docs. Close issues only when the committed
evidence satisfies the issue, not when progress is merely directionally good.

When using subagents, prefer the project-scoped role agents under `.pi/agents/`
over ad hoc prompts:

- `attack-surface-recon` — Glasswing-style trust-boundary mapping and narrow
  vulnerability hunt queue generation.
- `evidence-auditor` — status/readiness/issue closure honesty.
- `security-reviewer` — adversarial TLS/crypto/security review.
- `implementation-reviewer` — practical Zig/API/test review.
- `footgun-reviewer` — process, generated-artifact, benchmark, and
  maintainability traps.
- `benchmark-methodologist` — benchmark equivalence, perf, and disassembly
  evidence.
- `conformance-planner` — TLS-Anvil/BoGo/tlsfuzzer evidence planning.
- `slice-worker` — narrow code-writing worker for approved issue slices.
- `whitehat-hacker` — Opus 4.8/high-thinking vulnerability hunter/tracer for
  scoped hostile-input, parser-abuse, memory-corruption, and fuzz-target work.
- `vuln-validator` — independent validation pass that tries to disprove one
  `whitehat-hacker` finding without generating new findings.
- `siege` — Fable 5 escalation tier for the hunts whose reasoning depth is
  beyond opus. Reserved for the hardest, highest-value work; refuses anything
  without a recon doc, single attack class, single surface, and trust boundary.
- `fuzz-engineer` — owns fuzz target infrastructure, corpus, and coverage
  mapping for Sans-I/O parser/state-machine surfaces. The Infra stage of the
  Glasswing pipeline; builds targets and corpora, does not hunt.
- `perf-engineer` — owns the measure → disasm → change → remeasure loop for
  Pillar 3. Produces the perf/disasm evidence `benchmark-methodologist` audits.
- `docs-librarian` — owns internal documentation consistency. Audits prose
  against the `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` spine, applies surgical corrections,
  and proposes guardrails. Status lives in the spine, nowhere else.
- `herald` — owns public-facing voice, branding, positioning, and user-facing
  docs (README, why-tls, the front door). Internal doc consistency belongs to
  `docs-librarian`; herald speaks outward and is allowed voice and opinion.
- `matt-nits` — mechanical auto-applier for the Matt-style checklist. Runs a
  fixed list of pattern edits in place; never invents rules, never styles
  vendored code.

Keep them bounded: scouting, adversarial review, or implementation of a narrow
approved plan. Treat reviewer output as advisory until the parent verifies it
against code, tests, RFC text, and local commands. Give subagents explicit output
paths and do not let a stalled child block the parent from inspecting status and
recovering.

For vulnerability research, follow the Cloudflare/Project Glasswing harness
shape rather than a single broad scan: recon the trust boundary, run many narrow
hunts by attack class and scope, require proof artifacts where practical, send
candidate findings through an independent validator, then dedupe, trace
reachability from public APIs, gapfill missed surfaces, and write structured
reports. `whitehat-hacker` is for Hunt/Trace. `vuln-validator` is for Validate.
Do not ask either agent to “find vulnerabilities in the repo” without a narrowed
attack class and target surface.

Treat `.pi/agents/` prompts as living project code. After each meaningful chunk
of work, reflect on whether the role prompts should change based on observed
agent behavior: add missing constraints, tighten vague responsibilities, split
roles that are too broad, and delete instructions that are stale, redundant, or
counterproductive. Prefer many narrow, specialized agents over a few generic
ones when a repeated task has a clear checklist or attack surface.

Long-running remote work needs process hygiene. Use one durable terminal/session,
record the command, check for existing remote jobs before starting another, and
clean up partial outputs before collecting evidence. Never publish benchmark or
conformance results from a run that had duplicate workers, a dirty tree, missing
provenance, or unclear ownership of generated files.

---

## Code Style

- Prefer `ast-grep` for structural searches and mechanical refactors. Use plain
  text tools for literal text, but reach for syntax-aware matching before ad hoc
  regex scripts when changing code.
- Zig only for library code. No C source files except generated bindings.
- Use `std.debug.assert` liberally for invariants, never for input validation.
- Error sets are explicit. No `anyerror` in public API functions.
- Prefer `comptime` for configuration that is fixed at compile time.
- No `std.heap` imports in `src/`. If a file needs an allocator, it's in the
  wrong place.
- Keep functions short. If a function doesn't fit on a screen, it probably does
  too much.
- Format with `zig fmt`. Non-negotiable.
- `zig fmt` is necessary but NOT sufficient: it does not enforce line length
  (`ziglint` Z024) or the `std-alias` ast-grep rules, and `just lint-fixtures`
  rejects tracked binary fixtures (`.der`/`.bin`/`.sig` — embed DER via
  `decodeSection()` in `tests/fixtures/fixtures.zig` instead, as
  `rsa_pss` does). Run `just lint` (full lint, not just `zig fmt --check`)
  before committing, and `just ci` before pushing — a green `zig build test` +
  `zig fmt --check` alone can still leave `just ci` red.

---

## Tests

Every test cites the RFC section it validates. Format:

```zig
// RFC 8446 §5.3 — per-record nonce is XOR of IV with big-endian sequence number
test "nonce construction" { ... }
```

Protocol tests cite the spec section they validate. Utility tests that are not
direct protocol assertions should name the invariant or behavior clearly. Error
path tests are not optional.

**A test is only evidence if you have seen it fail for the right reason.**
Reproduce before fixing whenever you can: a failing artifact in hand cannot pass
for the wrong reason. When the bug was found some other way — manually, against
a real peer, in CI — you owe a mutation check before claiming the test guards
it: revert the fix, confirm red, restore. Confirm it fails *on the assertion you
care about*. A mutation check that hangs, or that trips a different assertion,
has told you nothing. Record the result in the commit or issue comment; "tests
pass" is not the claim being made.

**Tests whose outcome depends on I/O interleaving must not assert coincidences.**
Anything over a socketpair, a thread, or an event loop sees one interleaving out
of many, and the one you observed is not the contract. Either force the ordering
so only one is possible, or assert something true under all of them. Two real
failures from one session: asserting a peer's plaintext was still at a particular
place in a record buffer (true only when two records coalesced into one read —
the invariant was "not all zero"), and testing a server against a peer that sent
`close_notify` when only a bare FIN could expose the bug (the polite path
self-healed, so the test passed with the bug in place). `just flake-check` reruns
a suite to shake out the first kind; only forcing the condition fixes the second.

**Unit tests** usually live in the same file as the code they test (`test` blocks).

**Integration tests** live in `src/test/` and examples. The harnesses connect a
a TLS client to a TLS server in memory and exercise both directions against
`openssl s_server` / `openssl s_client` as ground-truth peers.

**Conformance tests** live under `conformance/` as a discrete subproject with
its own `build.zig`, `justfile`, Python environment, and harness code. The root
workspace delegates to `just conformance/ci`; when working on conformance, `cd
conformance` and use its local `just fmt`, `just lint`, and suite recipes.

---

## Performance Evidence

Benchmark numbers are evidence only when the run is reproducible and the measured
work is equivalent. Commit raw outputs, metadata, and analysis together under
`docs/research/perf/<timestamp-host>/`; do not cite ignored `zig-out/` artifacts
as durable evidence. EC2 benchmark captures use `infra/bench/` and
`just bench-capture-default`; local captures are workflow smoke tests unless the
issue explicitly asks for local data.

Historical captures under `docs/research/perf/<timestamp-host>/` (and any other
timestamped evidence directory) are **provenance-bound and immutable**. Their
raw outputs — symbol names, source paths, counts, disassembly — reflect the
binary measured at the git revision recorded in their metadata. Do not
retroactively edit those contents when a file path or symbol renames later; a
renamed symbol in an old capture is a lie about what was measured. When a
refactor renames or relocates a symbol, leave historical captures alone and
exclude `docs/research/perf/` from any "no references to X" grep validation.
If a path rename makes a historical citation ambiguous, add a forward pointer,
do not rewrite the capture.

Before claiming tls is faster or slower, identify the comparable row in
`docs/research/PERFORMANCE.md`, confirm what each implementation does inside the
timed loop, and explain the delta with objective evidence. Wall-time alone is
not enough for performance claims: collect `perf` data and disassembly for hot
rows so the result can be tied to instruction counts, symbols, cache/branch
behavior, copies avoided, or library overhead. If you cannot explain why a row is
faster or slower, call it a measurement, not a conclusion.

Ignore mixed geomeans when benchmark sets differ. Keep tls-only rows,
EVP/raw-crypto rows, libssl rows, and rustls rows labeled by their measurement
boundary. A pretty `benchstat` table is not proof of apples-to-apples work.

---

## Crypto

Production crypto comes from the libcrypto family. OpenSSL/libcrypto is the
first implementation target because it is already in the dev shell and interop
harnesses; AWS-LC must remain a first-class design target, with BoringSSL
possible later behind its own backend if the API surface is worth it.

Do not add or preserve a `std.crypto` backend as a parallel product path. This
has no public API contract; there is no compatibility reason to keep transitional
backend scaffolding once the production direction is chosen.

The strict no-allocation invariant applies to tls-owned framing, state machine,
record buffers, and caller-visible TLS I/O. A libcrypto-family production build
may link libc and may execute backend/provider-owned allocations during setup or
primitive initialization. Keep tls itself allocator-free: no `std.heap` in
`src/`, no malloc/free owned by tls, and all TLS input/output buffers remain
caller-owned.

Do not use libssl in core. Do not implement your own primitive crypto. Post-
quantum support should come through provider-backed key exchange and signature
mechanisms where the selected libcrypto-family backend supports them.

---

## RFCs

Full RFC text is in `docs/research/rfcs/`. Read them. When in doubt, read the
RFC. When still in doubt, read the RFC again.

Primary reference: `rfc8446-tls13.txt` (RFC 8446).

Key sections for implementation:
- §5 — Record protocol (start here)
- §5.3 — Per-record nonce
- §7.1 — Key schedule
- §4.4.4 — Finished MAC
- Appendix A — State machine
- Appendix B — Wire format reference

---

## API Stability

We have no public API contract yet.
Do not hesitate to change function signatures, rename types, restructure
modules, or rethink abstractions. The cost of changing things now is zero.
The cost of not changing them later is high. Move fast and don't apologize
for breaking things that aren't contracted.

---

## Zig Style

Type annotations go on the left side of the declaration. The right side uses
`.init()` or `.{}` — never repeat the type name on the right.

```zig
// correct
const iv: Iv = .init(@splat(0));
const key: Aes128GcmKey = .init(@splat(0xab));
var tag: Tag = undefined;

// wrong
const iv = Iv.init(@splat(0));
const key = Aes128GcmKey.init(@splat(0xab));
```

This applies to all typed values — newtypes, structs, enums. Consistent with
how Zig struct literals work: `.{}`, `.init()`, `.{ .field = val }` are all
resolved from the declared type on the left.

**Booleans are near useless; prefer named states.** A `bool` field costs a whole
byte (plus padding) to carry one bit, and a bare `true`/`false` at a call site
communicates nothing. Before writing one, check in order: does it encode anything
at all (if every site passes the same literal, delete it and comment the
invariant); do two bools describe one thing with a meaningless combination (use
one `enum` so the illegal state is unrepresentable); are they several independent
flags on a struct (use `std.EnumSet` — `flags.contains(.busy)`, one byte for the
whole group, each tag documented); is it presence of a thing (`?T`, not
`has_thing: bool`); is it a two-valued parameter (a named `enum`, so callers read
`.abortive` instead of `false`). A `bool` survives only as a single independent
predicate whose field name already reads as a question. `matt-nits` enforces this
mechanically; write it correctly the first time instead.

**Prefer pointer captures for large union variants.** When switching on a
union whose variants carry large payloads (hundreds of bytes+), capture by
pointer (`.kem => |*k|`) rather than by value (`.kem => |k|`). Zig 0.15 had an
x86_64 codegen bug where by-value capture of a large union variant can compute
a wrong field offset for nested fields, silently rotating/corrupting the
payload (aarch64 is unaffected). This bit the KEM `KeyShare` variant (a 1665-
byte `ArrayBuffer` rotated 32 bytes) — see #65. Pointer captures are
semantically equivalent for read-only access and avoid the large copy anyway.
For the same reason, pass large unions/structs by `*const` into functions and
write parsed large structs into a caller-provided out-param instead of
returning them by value.

**Widen narrow-type arithmetic in parser bounds checks.** Zig evaluates
`narrow_type + comptime_int` in the narrow type before widening for the
comparison. A bounds check like `if (remaining < len + N)` where `len` is a
`u8`/`u16`/`u24` overflows the narrow type when `len` is near its max, causing
a panic (Debug/ReleaseSafe) or UB (ReleaseFast) before the comparison rejects
the oversized input. This is a remote DoS class on any parser that reads an
attacker-controlled length field — #72 found 14 sites. Always write the
addition in `usize`: `if (remaining < @as(usize, len) + N)`. `ziglint` does
not catch this; the security agents (`whitehat-hacker`, `attack-surface-recon`,
`security-reviewer`) have it in their checklists.

---

## What Not To Do

- Don't add TLS 1.2 support. The scope is TLS 1.3. Period.
- Don't add Windows-specific code paths.
- Don't reach for an allocator to "simplify" something. Simplify the design.
- Don't write a test without citing a spec section.
- Don't commit benchmarks that haven't been run. Benchmark results in comments
  should include the machine, build flags, date, git revision, dirty state,
  backend/library versions, and raw outputs.
- Don't paper over a performance problem with a comment like "good enough for
  now." File it, measure it, and fix it or explicitly defer it with a note on
  what's blocking.
- Don't use `std.log` or print-debugging in library code. Use test assertions.
- Don't assert project status anywhere except `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.
- Don't create a todo without first searching for an existing one on the same
  feature. Extend, don't fork.
- Don't close a todo or raise a readiness status on partial work. Say partial.
- Don't invent a new top-level home for a file when the taxonomy already defines
  one. Raise it instead of improvising.
- Don't link or name `docs/slop/` from a human document. `just lint` fails
  the build when you do.

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` is one file, Keep a Changelog format, newest first. Add a bullet
under `## [Unreleased]` in the same change that alters something a user can
notice: the public API, expected behavior, performance a benchmark row would
show, a supported backend, or the build requirements. Docs, CI, and internal
refactors do not need one unless they change how someone uses the package.

Write from the user's side: what changed, and what they must do about it. Name
the symbol, flag, or error. One line, under Added, Changed, Fixed, or Removed.

To release, dispatch the repo's `release.yml` with the version. The workflow
moves the Unreleased section into a dated heading, sets `.version` in
`build.zig.zon`, commits, tags, and opens the GitHub release. Do not tag by hand.
