//! Per-connection TLS state machine driven by libxev completions.
//!
//! The whole design problem is that tls-std's drive loop owns the stack:
//!
//!     while (!hs.isConnected()) { const n = blocking_read(...); ... }
//!
//! There is no stack to own here. `pump` is that loop turned inside out — every
//! local became a field, and each completion callback re-enters `pump` to make
//! whatever progress is now possible. `RecordBuffer` makes this workable because
//! its position is already resumable state: a partially drained buffer just
//! needs `next()` called again.
//!
//! Buffers are caller-owned slices, as everywhere in tls. Records decrypt in
//! place inside `record` storage, so a decrypted record can outlast one `read`
//! if the caller's destination is smaller; `pending` holds the remainder, and
//! nothing may touch the record buffer while it is non-empty.
