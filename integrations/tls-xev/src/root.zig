//! tls-xev: non-blocking TLS 1.3 over [libxev](https://github.com/mitchellh/libxev).
//!
//! libxev is a callback-completion event loop with its own API — it does not
//! implement `std.Io` — so unlike a `std.Io` runtime this genuinely needs an
//! adapter rather than working through `tls-std` unchanged. See #76.
//!
//! The shape is deliberately NOT tls-std's. tls-std is a blocking wrapper:
//! `connect` owns the stack and drives the handshake to completion in a loop,
//! and reads/writes present `std.Io.Reader`/`std.Io.Writer`. Neither survives
//! here. In a completion world the callback *is* the loop body and every local
//! becomes connection state; and `Io.Reader.stream` is a synchronous contract
//! that must produce bytes or fail, with no way to say "call me back", so there
//! is no byte-stream seam to offer. Callers get explicit operations with
//! callbacks instead.
//!
//! What tls-std does share: `tls.errors.classify` for the coarse failure
//! buckets, so both integrations project from one exhaustive table.
//!
//! API contract, in one place:
//!
//! - Every operation returns `void` and invokes its callback **exactly once**,
//!   including for failures detected synchronously. A caller never handles the
//!   same failure in two places.
//! - Callbacks take a typed `ctx` — no `anyopaque`, no `xev.Completion`. The
//!   `Conn` owns its completions, one per direction plus teardown, which is what
//!   lets a read and a write be in flight together.
//! - Reads and writes may overlap each other. Two reads may not, and neither may
//!   two writes: the second is rejected with `Error.Concurrent` delivered to its
//!   callback.
//! - Operations are state-gated. Issuing one past `.established` fails with
//!   `Error.Closed` rather than asserting, because a late read is a plausible
//!   caller race rather than a memory-safety bug.
//!
//! Shape and vocabulary follow a proven server-side libxev TLS integration; the
//! `ReadResult` split in particular is lifted from it.
