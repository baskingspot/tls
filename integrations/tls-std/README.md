# tls-std

Opinionated TLS 1.3 stream wrapper over Zig 0.16 `std.Io.net`.

`tls` core is Sans-I/O: you feed it bytes and get bytes out. `tls-std` packages
the proven drive loop with sane defaults so a caller can wrap a connected
`std.Io.net.Stream` and get a TLS connection — `connect`/`read`/`write`/`close` —
without writing a Sans-I/O loop. Zig 0.16 only. This is the reference
integration; `tls-xev` and `tls-ktls` adapt its handshake-to-completion loop.

Readiness status for this integration lives in
[`PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`](../../PRODUCTION_READINESS.md), not here. The
implementation landed under [#77](https://github.com/baskingspot/tls/issues/77).

## Install

Fetch the root tls package, then import its `tls_std` module. One dependency
contains core and all integration sources; this module requires Zig 0.16.

```zig
const tls_dep = b.dependency("tls", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});
const tls_std = tls_dep.module("tls_std");
```

See [`docs/USAGE.md`](../../docs/USAGE.md#fresh-project-setup) for the complete
consumer wiring.

## Design principles

1. **Eager handshake.** `connect`/`accept` run the TLS handshake to completion
   before returning. Handshake errors (cert verification, ALPN no-overlap,
   `illegal_parameter`) surface at call time — their natural home — not leaked
   into the first `read`. The `Io.Reader`/`Io.Writer` vtable contract is "this
   is a byte stream"; a `stream` callback that secretly negotiates a handshake
   mid-read would be surprising and force every vtable method to carry
   handshake-error variants. (Go's lazy auto-handshake is the part of
   `crypto/tls` that bites; `std.Io.net` separates `connect` from I/O, so we
   own the connect step and put the handshake there — matching `tokio-rustls`.)
2. **Honest stream interface.** `Stream` exposes `Reader`/`Writer` structs
   embedding `interface: std.Io.Reader`/`std.Io.Writer`, mirroring
   `std.Io.net.Stream.Reader`/`Writer`. Every stdlib reader API works, including
   the cross-record ones a line-oriented parser needs (`peek`, `takeInt`,
   `takeDelimiterInclusive`). A consumer taking `*std.Io.Reader`/`*std.Io.Writer`
   works unmodified — TLS is invisible. See the buffering-layer section for why
   this rules out a zero-copy read path.
3. **Consume the underlying stream.** `connect`/`accept` move the
   `std.Io.net.Stream` into the `Stream`. `close()` flushes, sends
   `close_notify`, and closes the socket. `closeWrite()` does the same without
   the close, which matters for request/response clients after stdin EOF.
   `socketHandle()` exposes the fd for readiness multiplexing and kTLS.
4. **Per-call `Options`, no `Config`+`Connector`.** A `Config`+`Connector`+
   `TlsStream` triple is more than `connect(stream, Options)` needs. The only
   genuinely reusable, allocation-bearing piece is the cert bundle, and it's
   passed by `*const` pointer in `Options` — reuse is free without a connector
   type.
5. **Verification is a required decision.** `Options.verify` has no default, so
   no caller gets an unverified connection by omission. `.system_bundle` carries
   the allocator it needs, `.bundle` pins your own store, and `.insecure` is an
   explicit, greppable opt-out.
6. **Comptime-sized buffers.** tls core uses caller-owned buffers. `Config`
   exposes each size. The defaults accept the largest supported records and
   handshakes. A caller with thousands of connections can reduce
   look-ahead and reassembly capacity. Nothing is hidden or mandatory.
7. **In-place init.** `Client`/`Server` are large and self-referential — the
   record buffer, handshake reassembly buffer, and both `Io` interfaces point
   into the struct. Declare `undefined`, `connect`/`accept` in place, never move
   the value afterward (the `std.Thread.Pool` pattern). A moved Stream trips an
   assert in Debug/ReleaseSafe instead of corrupting memory silently. The caller
   chooses placement (stack for one connection, heap/arena for many).
8. **Fatal errors reach the peer.** RFC 8446 §6.2 says a fatal error SHOULD be
   reported with an alert. A failed `connect` sends `bad_certificate` /
   `illegal_parameter` / `no_application_protocol` as appropriate, then closes,
   so the peer logs a reason instead of a bare FIN.

## Concurrent split halves

One reader task and one writer task can use a connected `Stream` concurrently.
This includes green-thread runtimes such as [zio](https://github.com/lalinsky/zio).
Multiple readers or multiple writers remain unsupported.

RX uses only the receive record layer and its own staging buffers. TX operations
share one `std.Io.Mutex`, one record buffer, and one pending-write latch. The TX
lease covers encryption, the full transport write, and `completeWrite()`.
Therefore, wire order always matches the sequence-number order.

A received `KeyUpdate(update_requested)` publishes an atomic pending request.
The reader or the next writer sends `KeyUpdate(update_not_requested)` under the
old TX key. Application data and `close_notify` wait behind that response.

A failed transport write permanently poisons TX. The first operation reports the
transport cause. Later operations report `TxPoisoned`, because the connection
cannot determine how many encrypted bytes reached the peer.

Call `abort()` to wake blocked halves without clearing their state. Do not race
`abort()` with `close()` or `deinit()`. Join both tasks first. The join and
single-reader/single-writer rules use assertions; ReleaseFast does not check
violations and cannot make premature teardown memory-safe.

## Public API

### Verification policy (client)

```zig
pub const Verify = union(enum) {
    /// Load the OS trust store with `gpa` and verify the server certificate
    /// chain against it. The bundle is freed before `connect` returns, so a
    /// client opening many connections should build one bundle and pass
    /// `.bundle` instead of rescanning the trust store per connection.
    system_bundle: std.mem.Allocator,
    /// Verify against a caller-owned bundle (pin a root / custom store).
    bundle: *const std.crypto.Certificate.Bundle,
    /// Skip chain-anchor verification (sets tls `insecure_no_chain_anchor`).
    /// Hostname verification still runs unless `host` is null. Demo/test only.
    insecure,
};
```

The allocator lives in the `.system_bundle` payload rather than in `connect`'s
signature, because that is the only mode that needs one. `connect` is therefore
`connect(io, sock, options)` with no phantom parameter and no "ignored otherwise"
caveat.

### Buffer configuration

```zig
pub const Config = struct {
    record_storage: usize = tls_core.RecordBuffer.recommended_storage,
    reassembly_storage: ?usize = null, // null = the core's recommendation
    read_buffer: usize = tls_core.frame.max_plaintext_len,
    write_buffer: usize = tls_core.frame.max_plaintext_len,
    peer_chain_storage: ?usize = null, // client: retain the peer chain
    client_identity_storage: ?usize = null, // server: retain the client leaf
};

pub fn ClientWith(comptime config: Config) type;
pub fn ServerWith(comptime config: Config) type;
pub const Client = ClientWith(.{});
pub const Server = ServerWith(.{});
```

`read_buffer` is the reader's look-ahead, so it bounds `peek(n)`, `takeInt`, and
`takeDelimiterInclusive` line length; past it those report
`error.StreamTooLong`. It must be at least one record payload
(`tls_core.frame.max_plaintext_len`).

`client_identity_storage` is the server-side counterpart: bytes reserved for
the verified client leaf DER behind `info().client_identity`. `null` verifies
and discards the leaf; too small for the presented leaf surfaces as
`error.HandshakeBufferTooShort` from `accept`.

`peer_chain_storage` is `null` by default because retaining the verified chain
for `info().peer_chain` costs one handshake-sized (64 KiB) buffer, and most
callers never look at it. Opt in when you do:

```zig
const IntrospectingClient = tls.ClientWith(.{
    .peer_chain_storage = tls_core.ClientHandshake.recommended_handshake_storage,
});
```

`test "Config: buffer sizing is the whole story of the Stream footprint"` pins
each knob to an exact `@sizeOf` delta and keeps the default types below their
stated ceilings.

### Client / Server

`Client` and `Server` ARE the connection types — not namespaces around one.
They share an implementation (`StreamImpl(Hs, role, config)`), so
`reader`/`writer`/`socketHandle`/`hasBuffered`/`selectedAlpn`/`info`/
`closeWrite`/`abort`/`close`/`deinit` exist on both; `connect` is client-only and
`accept` is server-only (calling the wrong one is a compile error, not a runtime
surprise).

```zig
pub const Client = /* ClientWith(.{}) */ struct {
    pub const Options = struct {
        /// SNI + certificate hostname (SAN/CN) to verify. Required for real
        /// verification; null disables BOTH SNI and hostname verification.
        host: ?[]const u8 = null,
        /// No default: a TLS client should not skip this by omission.
        verify: Verify,
        /// ALPN protocols to offer (e.g. &.{ "h2", "http/1.1" }). Borrowed.
        alpn: []const []const u8 = &.{},
        /// RFC 10024 hybrid supported-groups and initial key-share policy.
        /// Disabled by default; borrowed slices must outlive the handshake.
        hybrid: tls_core.ClientHandshake.HybridPolicy = .{},
        /// Present this chain + signer when the server sends a
        /// CertificateRequest. An empty chain is `InvalidOptions` before any
        /// wire I/O. Borrowed for the handshake. RFC 8446 §4.4.2, §4.4.3.
        client_credentials: ?ClientCredentials = null,
    };

    /// Wrap a CONNECTED `std.Io.net.Stream` and run the TLS 1.3 handshake to
    /// completion. Moves the socket into `s`. Eager: all handshake errors
    /// surface here. On failure the peer gets a fatal alert where one is
    /// warranted, the socket is closed, and buffers are zeroed — a later
    /// `deinit` is harmless but unnecessary.
    pub fn connect(
        s: *Client,
        io: std.Io,
        stream: std.Io.net.Stream,
        options: Options,
    ) ConnectError!void;

    pub fn reader(s: *Client) *std.Io.Reader;
    pub fn writer(s: *Client) *std.Io.Writer;

    /// The underlying socket handle, for readiness multiplexing (`poll`,
    /// `epoll`, `kqueue`) or kTLS setup. Reading or writing it directly
    /// desynchronizes the record layer.
    pub fn socketHandle(s: *const Client) std.Io.net.Socket.Handle;

    /// True when a read can return data without touching the transport
    /// (decrypted bytes pending, or a complete record already framed).
    pub fn hasBuffered(s: *Client) bool;

    /// ALPN protocol selected by the server, or null. Valid after connect.
    pub fn selectedAlpn(s: *const Client) ?[]const u8;

    /// Cipher suite, ALPN, and (if configured) the verified peer DER chain.
    pub fn info(s: *const Client) Info;

    /// Flush, send close_notify, keep the read side open for the peer's
    /// response. Idempotent.
    pub fn closeWrite(s: *Client) void;

    /// Wake blocked halves without clearing connection state. Idempotent.
    pub fn abort(s: *Client) void;

    /// Flush, send close_notify, close the socket. Idempotent. Join both halves
    /// before this call.
    pub fn close(s: *Client) void;

    /// Close the socket and clear every wrapper-owned buffer. Join both halves
    /// before this call. A failed connect makes this function a no-op.
    pub fn deinit(s: *Client) void;
};
```

Before socket creation, call `Client.Options.validate()` for exact hybrid and credential policy errors. `connect` repeats the check before key generation. `connect` maps these failures to `InvalidOptions`.

tls returns lent storage unchanged by design ([#81](https://github.com/baskingspot/tls/issues/81)). The wrapper declares and clears all its buffers. These buffers include record data and decrypted application plaintext.

`Server.Options` carries credentials instead of a verification policy:

```zig
pub const Options = struct {
    /// Certificate chain, leaf first, DER. Borrowed for the connection's life.
    cert_chain: []const []const u8,
    /// Signer for CertificateVerify. Obtained from
    /// `var key: tls_core.signature.PrivateKey = try .fromP256Scalar(scalar);
    ///  defer key.deinit(); key.signer()` — the `PrivateKey` must outlive
    /// the handshake (caller-owned). Borrowed.
    signer: tls_core.signature.Signer,
    /// ALPN protocols supported. Borrowed.
    alpn: []const []const u8 = &.{},
    /// RFC 10024 hybrid groups accepted in server preference order.
    hybrid_groups: []const tls_core.kex.NamedGroup = &.{},
    /// Client-certificate policy. Default `.none`. RFC 8446 §4.4.2.
    client_auth: ClientAuth = .none,
};
```

Before socket acceptance, call `Server.Options.validate()` for exact hybrid and credential policy errors. `accept` repeats the check before key generation. `accept` maps hybrid faults to `InvalidOptions`.

`info()` exposes negotiated metadata without making callers spelunk through
handshake state:

```zig
pub const Info = struct {
    cipher_suite: tls_core.CipherSuite,
    alpn: ?[]const u8,
    peer_chain: []const []const u8, // client-side verified DER; see Config
    client_identity: ?[]const u8,   // server-side verified client leaf DER
};
```

### Client authentication (mTLS)

Both directions are supported and CI-gated against `openssl s_server -Verify`
and `openssl s_client -cert -key`, including required-certificate rejection
when either client omits credentials:

```zig
pub const ClientCredentials = struct {
    cert_chain: []const []const u8, // DER, leaf first; borrowed
    signer: tls_core.signature.Signer,  // signs CertificateVerify; borrowed
};

pub const ClientTrust = union(enum) {
    bundle: *const std.crypto.Certificate.Bundle, // caller-owned anchors
    insecure,                                     // demo/test opt-out
};

pub const ClientAuth = union(enum) {
    none,                        // default
    optional: ClientTrust,       // empty client Certificate is accepted
    required: ClientTrust,       // empty client Certificate is rejected
};
```

A client passes `Options.client_credentials`; a server passes
`Options.client_auth`. There is deliberately no server-side system-bundle mode
and no separate `insecure` bool — a server authenticating clients pins its own
CA, which is the normal mTLS deployment shape. A non-none server mode uses the
real `Io.Timestamp` clock for client-certificate validity.

Two wrapper-side classification details are pinned by tests: a client signer
whose scheme the server's CertificateRequest cannot carry, and a client chain
too large for one record, are `InvalidOptions` (caller configuration), while a
verified client leaf that does not fit `client_identity_storage` is
`HandshakeBufferTooShort` (sizing). Handshake failure alerts go through the
canonical per-error tls table, so a peer logging the failure sees
`unknown_ca` / `certificate_expired` / `decrypt_error` rather than a generic
`bad_certificate`.

### Error sets

Curated public sets projected from the ~90-variant core sets. Each variant says
who is at fault and what a caller can do about it:

```zig
pub const ConnectError = error{
    CertificateVerificationFailed, // chain / hostname / validity / CertificateVerify
    TlsDecryptError,               // Finished MAC or record AEAD tag failed
    TlsAlertReceived,              // peer aborted with a fatal alert
    HandshakeProtocolError,        // malformed, unexpected, or illegal peer message
    RecordOverflow,                // peer record exceeded RFC 8446 §5.1
    HandshakeBufferTooShort,       // raise Config.record_storage / reassembly_storage
    InvalidOptions,                // caller-supplied ALPN list or host length
    InternalError,                 // libcrypto failure, counter overflow, broken invariant
    OutOfMemory,                   // verify == .system_bundle trust-store load
} || std.Io.net.Stream.Reader.Error || std.Io.net.Stream.Writer.Error
  || std.Io.Cancelable || std.Io.UnexpectedError;

pub const AcceptError = error{
    MissingCredentials, ClientCertificateRejected, CertificateVerificationFailed,
    TlsDecryptError, TlsAlertReceived, HandshakeProtocolError,
    UnsupportedCipherSuite, NoApplicationProtocol, RecordOverflow,
    HandshakeBufferTooShort, InvalidOptions, InternalError,
} || /* same transport tail */;
```

The mapping goes through one `classify` table over the union of every core
handshake error set, projected per role. The table is **exhaustive on purpose —
no `else` arm**: adding a variant to a core error set is a compile error here
until someone decides which coarse class it belongs to. Silently degrading a new
certificate failure into a generic protocol error is exactly the bug that shape
prevents. The same core error can legitimately mean different things per role —
`UnsupportedCipherSuite` is a real negotiation outcome for a server and an
`illegal_parameter` violation for a client — and the projections say so.

Post-handshake reads and writes go through the `Io.Reader`/`Io.Writer` vtable,
whose `Error` sets are narrow by design — `error{ReadFailed, EndOfStream}` for
Reader and `error{WriteFailed}` for Writer. All TLS-specific failures
(decrypt/auth errors, alert received) collapse to `ReadFailed` on the read path
and `WriteFailed` on the write path. Both a clean `close_notify` and a transport
EOF without one surface as `error.EndOfStream` — RFC 8446 §6.1 requires
`close_notify`, but hard-closing the transport is ubiquitous on the real internet
and the reader cannot distinguish truncation from a rude close anyway; callers
that care about truncation must frame their own protocol (Content-Length,
chunked, etc.).

`ReadFailed` and `WriteFailed` are not dead ends, though. Following the
`std.Io.net.Stream.Reader.err` convention, the real cause is recorded before the
narrow error is returned, and `readError()` / `writeError()` recover it:

```zig
pub const ReadError = error{
    TlsAborted,         // abort stopped the connection
    TxPoisoned,         // an earlier encrypted write did not complete
    TlsAlertReceived,   // peer sent a fatal alert
    TlsDecryptError,    // record failed to authenticate (AEAD tag / MAC)
    TlsProtocolError,   // malformed, unexpected, or illegal record
    RecordOverflow,     // record longer than RFC 8446 §5.1 permits
    IdleRecordFlood,    // see the bounded-control-record section below
    InternalError,      // backend failure, counter overflow, broken invariant
} || std.Io.net.Stream.Reader.Error   // includes error.Canceled
  || std.Io.net.Stream.Writer.Error   // KeyUpdate responses are written while reading
  || std.Io.Cancelable || std.Io.UnexpectedError;

pub const WriteError = error{
    TlsAborted,         // abort stopped the connection
    TxPoisoned,         // an earlier encrypted write did not complete
    TlsClosed,          // closeWrite/close already ran
    TlsProtocolError,
    InternalError,
} || std.Io.net.Stream.Writer.Error || std.Io.Cancelable || std.Io.UnexpectedError;
```

```zig
r.fillMore() catch |err| switch (err) {
    error.EndOfStream => {},              // clean close_notify
    error.ReadFailed => switch (conn.readError().?) {
        error.Canceled => {},             // the task was cancelled, not broken
        error.TlsDecryptError => {},      // a record failed to authenticate
        else => {},
    },
};
```

This matters most on a runtime built around cancellation. Without it, a cancelled
task is indistinguishable from a forged record or a dead socket — see
`examples/zio_client.zig`. The values are only meaningful immediately after the
interface returned `ReadFailed`/`WriteFailed`, and are never cleared, exactly like
the stdlib's.

## The byte-stream buffering layer (the one piece of real new code)

TLS records don't align with `read()` calls: one transport read can deliver a
partial record, multiple records, or app data plus a `key_update` /
`new_session_ticket` together. The `Reader` vtable adapts the record-oriented
`ReceiveEvent` loop to a flat byte stream. The event union stays invisible to
the caller:

1. While the reader's buffer holds bytes, the generic `Io.Reader` serves them —
   the vtable isn't even called.
2. On exhaustion, `stream` copies from the pending decrypted record into the
   destination the generic layer supplied. When nothing is pending it drives the
   record loop: read transport into `RecordBuffer.writable()`, `advance(n)`,
   loop `rb.next()` → `receiveRecord`, and switch on the `ReceiveEvent`:
   - `.application_data` → becomes the pending plaintext window and is copied
     out (zero-length fragments are skipped; RFC 8446 §5.1 allows them).
   - `.key_update` → publishes a response request, acquires TX, and sends it.
     The event never reaches the caller.
   - `.new_session_ticket` → swallow (a later `onTicket` hook is a non-stub
     future field, not a v1 knob); loop.
   - `.none` → loop.
   - `.closed` → return `error.EndOfStream`.
   - Transport returns 0 without `.closed` → `error.EndOfStream` (abrupt
     close; see the error-set section above for why this isn't ReadFailed).

### Why there is no zero-copy read path

An earlier revision repointed `interface.buffer` at the decrypted record inside
the `RecordBuffer` — genuinely zero copy, and permitted by the `Io.Reader`
`stream` contract ("store data in `buffer`, modifying `seek` and `end`"). It is
also unusable, because it makes the reader's *capacity* equal to the current
record's length. Every stdlib path that buffers across records then breaks:

- `peek(n)` past the current record: `fill` rebases the unconsumed tail to the
  front of the record window and asks the vtable for more, which either asserts
  or discards the tail.
- `takeDelimiterInclusive('\n')` — HTTP header parsing — bails out of its fill
  loop as soon as `buffer.len - content_len == 0`, which is always true for a
  partially consumed record, and then hits the same path.

Both are covered by tests now (`reader: peek past the current record keeps the
unconsumed tail`, `reader: takeDelimiterInclusive spans a record boundary`). The
current `stream` honors the vtable contract instead: one copy into the caller's
destination, which is a copy the caller needed anyway. `streamRemaining` and
friends still move record bytes straight to the sink with no intermediate copy,
which is where zero-copy actually pays.

### Bounded control-record work

A refill gives up with `error.ReadFailed` after 64 records that produce no
application data. RFC 8446 §5.1 puts no rate limit on zero-length
`application_data` fragments, so an uncooperative peer could otherwise keep a
`read` call from ever returning. The core already caps KeyUpdate and
NewSessionTicket floods (`TooManyKeyUpdates`, `TooManyNewSessionTickets`); this
covers what it does not count.

### Reader idioms

`readSliceShort()` tries to fill its entire destination buffer, so it blocks on a
keep-alive peer after a short response. For record-at-a-time reads, call
`fillMore()`, consume `buffered()`, then `toss()` that length. Use `hasBuffered()`
with poll loops to drain coalesced records without another transport read.

The `Writer` is `BufWriter`-shaped (matching `tokio-rustls`): `interface.buffer`
is a plaintext staging buffer sized to `Config.write_buffer` so each
`drain`/`flush` maps to one TLS record via `sendApplicationData` → write `out` →
`completeWrite`. Writes larger than the buffer loop into multiple records.
Nothing is encrypted until `flush`/`drain` — or until `close`/`closeWrite`, which
flush for you rather than zeroing bytes the caller believes it wrote.

## Usage

### Client: connect + write + read + close

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const tls = @import("tls_std");

pub fn main(init: std.process.Init) !void {
    const io = init.io;

    // 1. Make the TCP connection yourself (tls-std does NOT dial).
    const host_name = try std.Io.net.HostName.init("example.com");
    const sock = try host_name.connect(io, 443, .{ .mode = .stream });

    // 2. TLS handshake to completion (eager — errors surface here).
    var conn: tls.Client = undefined; // large + self-referential: init in place
    try conn.connect(io, sock, .{
        .host = "example.com",
        .verify = .{ .system_bundle = init.gpa },
        .alpn = &.{"http/1.1"},
    });
    defer conn.deinit();

    // 3. Write via the Io.Writer.
    const w = conn.writer();
    try w.writeAll("GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n");
    try w.flush();

    // 4. Read via the Io.Reader. Line-oriented parsing works: the reader
    // buffers across TLS record boundaries.
    const r = conn.reader();
    while (r.takeDelimiterInclusive('\n')) |line| {
        std.debug.print("{s}", .{line});
    } else |err| switch (err) {
        error.EndOfStream => {},   // clean close_notify
        error.ReadFailed => {},    // transport closed / TLS error
        error.StreamTooLong => {}, // line longer than Config.read_buffer
    }

    // 5. Close: flush + close_notify + close socket.
    conn.close();
}
```

### Server: accept + respond + close

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const tls_core = @import("tls");
const tls = @import("tls_std");

pub fn serveOne(io: std.Io, listener: *std.Io.net.Server,
                cert_der: []const u8, scalar: *const [32]u8) !void {
    const sock = try listener.accept(io);

    var key: tls_core.signature.PrivateKey = try .fromP256Scalar(scalar);
    defer key.deinit();

    var conn: tls.Server = undefined;
    try conn.accept(io, sock, .{
        .cert_chain = &.{cert_der}, // leaf-first DER
        .signer = key.signer(),     // key must outlive this accept() call
        .alpn = &.{"http/1.1"},
    });
    defer conn.deinit();

    const r = conn.reader();
    const request_line = try r.takeDelimiterInclusive('\n');
    if (!std.mem.startsWith(u8, request_line, "GET ")) return error.BadRequest;

    const w = conn.writer();
    try w.writeAll("HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: 5\r\n\r\nhello");
    conn.close(); // flushes for you
}
```

### Composing with a hypothetical `http.zig`

```zig
// http.zig takes *std.Io.Reader / *std.Io.Writer — it knows nothing about TLS.
var conn: tls.Client = undefined;
try conn.connect(io, sock, .{
    .host = "example.com",
    .verify = .{ .system_bundle = gpa },
    .alpn = &.{"http/1.1"},
});
defer conn.deinit();

const resp = try http.get(io, conn.reader(), conn.writer(), "/");
// key_update, new_session_ticket, and record reassembly are handled inside
// the TLS reader/writer vtables; http.zig is unmodified.
```

That third example is the whole point of the drop-in `Io.Reader`/`Io.Writer`
seam, and it is the reason the zero-copy read path had to go.

## Out of scope for v1

- **`std.http` integration** — `std.http` is not the target; community HTTP
  libs compose via the `*Io.Reader`/`*Io.Writer` seam instead.
- **Client-auth server-side retention beyond the leaf** — the wrapper retains
  the verified client leaf DER only (for `info().client_identity`), not the
  full client chain.
- **Session resumption / 0-RTT surface** — cut from v1.
- **Timeouts** — nothing here imposes a deadline. A slow peer can stall
  `connect` or a read indefinitely. `std.Io` cancellation is the intended
  mechanism and belongs to whoever owns the runtime. `abort()` provides manual
  wakeup for blocked halves. `examples/zio_client.zig` races the exchange
  against an `Io.Select` deadline. `readError()` then returns `error.Canceled`.
- **0.15 support** — all of tls is 0.16-only now (#144).
- **Distribution as an independently `zig fetch`-able package** — tracked by #79.

## Build

In-tree, depends on the tls core via a path dep (`../..`), the same pattern
`conformance/` uses. Devshell: the root default (`nix develop ../..`), or
just `cd` into this directory — direnv loads it via `.envrc`.

```
just build             # smoke executable
just test              # unit + round-trip + OpenSSL interop + example tests
just build-examples    # compile every example (no peer required)
just lint              # zig fmt, ziglint, workspace std-alias rules
just ci                # everything above
```

The OpenSSL CLI supplied by the devshell is a required test dependency. The
interop suite runs real TCP exchanges against `openssl s_server` and `s_client`
in both directions, including mTLS success and rejection paths; an absent
executable is a test failure, not a skip.

The root workspace delegates to this subproject through `just integrations-ci`,
which is wired into `just ci`. tls is Zig 0.16-only.

Run the example client against a real server:

```
printf 'GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: example.com\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n' | \
    zig build example-tls_client -- --host example.com
```

## Running on another `std.Io`: there is no `tls-zio`

tls-std targets `std.Io`, so it runs unmodified on any implementation of it.
[zio](https://github.com/lalinsky/zio) — a stackful-coroutine runtime with
io_uring/epoll/kqueue/IOCP backends — ships a full `std.Io`, so `rt.io()` goes
straight into `Client.connect` with no adapter:

```zig
var rt = try zio.Runtime.init(gpa, .{});
defer rt.deinit();

var conn: tls.Client = undefined;
try conn.connect(rt.io(), sock, .{ .host = host, .verify = .{ .system_bundle = gpa } });
```

A separate `tls-zio` package would be this file with `Io` replaced by `Io` — two
copies of the drive loop, the reader/writer vtables, and the error table to keep
in lockstep. `examples/zio_client.zig` is the integration instead, and `just ci`
builds it so the claim cannot rot. zio is a **lazy** dependency, so consuming
tls-std does not drag an I/O runtime into your tree.

That example also covers the one thing a coroutine runtime genuinely adds over
`std.Io.Threaded` here — a deadline, which tls-std deliberately does not provide
itself:

```
$ zio_client --host example.com --no-request --timeout-ms 800
[zio] handshake complete
[zio]   cipher: aes_128_gcm_sha256
[zio] --no-request: reading without asking for anything
[zio] deadline of 800ms expired
[zio] transfer cancelled by the deadline (recovered as error.Canceled)
```

`tls-xev` (#76) and `tls-ktls` (#78) do get their own packages, because libxev
is a callback-based completion loop with its own API and kTLS is a kernel offload.
Neither implements the interface tls-std already speaks.
