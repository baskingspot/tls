//! tls-std: opinionated TLS 1.3 stream wrapper over `std.Io.net` (Zig 0.16).
//!
//! Converts a connected `std.Io.net` stream into a TLS connection so a caller
//! can `connect`/`read`/`write`/`close` without writing a Sans-I/O drive loop.
//! This is the reference integration; tls-xev and tls-ktls adapt its
//! handshake-to-completion loop. See #77.
//!
//! Design: eager handshake (connect/accept run the full handshake before
//! returning), honest `Io.Reader`/`Io.Writer` seam (every stdlib reader API
//! works, including the cross-record ones an HTTP parser needs), and
//! comptime-sized caller-visible buffers so the ~200 KB default is a choice
//! rather than a tax.
//!
//! One reader task and one writer task can use a connected Stream concurrently.
//! TX operations share an `Io.Mutex` because record encryption advances the TX
//! sequence before the transport write completes. Reader-side KeyUpdate
//! responses use the same lease, so their wire order matches the TX key epoch.
//! Multiple readers or multiple writers remain unsupported because each
//! `Io.Reader` or `Io.Writer` interface owns mutable staging state.
//!
//! Call `abort()` to wake blocked halves. Join both tasks before `close()` or
//! `deinit()` tears down the socket and secret storage.
